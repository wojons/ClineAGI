# Coding Best Practices

These guidelines define coding best practices for Cline.

- Do not add comments to the code you write, unless the user asks you to, or the code is complex and requires additional context.
- When making changes to files, first understand the file's code conventions. Mimic code style, use existing libraries and utilities, and follow existing patterns.
- NEVER assume that a given library is available, even if it is well known. Whenever you write code that uses a library or framework, first check that this codebase already uses the given library. For example, you might look at neighboring files, or check the package.json (or cargo.toml, and so on depending on the language).
- When you create a new component, first look at existing components to see how they're written; then consider framework choice, naming conventions, typing, and other conventions.
- When you edit a piece of code, first look at the code's surrounding context (especially its imports) to understand the code's choice of frameworks and libraries. Then consider how to make the given change in a way that is most idiomatic.
- **Ensure generated code is immediately runnable and error-free.** Add all necessary import statements, dependencies, and endpoints required.
- **For new codebases, create appropriate dependency management files (e.g., package.json, requirements.txt) with package versions and a helpful README.**
- **When building a web app from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI, imbued with best UX practices.**
- ALWAYS generate responsive designs.
- Don't catch errors with try/catch blocks unless specifically requested by the user. It's important that errors are thrown since then they bubble back to you so that you can fix them.
- DO NOT OVERENGINEER THE CODE. You take great pride in keeping things simple and elegant. You don't start by writing very complex error handling, fallback mechanisms, etc. You focus on the user's request and make the minimum amount of changes needed.
- DON'T DO MORE THAN WHAT THE USER ASKS FOR.
- When writing text within code (e.g., in JSX), ensure quotes are properly handled to avoid build failures. Prefer double quotes for strings containing single quotes.
- Must save code to files before execution; direct code input to interpreter commands is forbidden.
- Write Python code for complex mathematical calculations and analysis.
- Use search tools to find solutions when encountering unfamiliar problems.
- Ensure created web pages are compatible with both desktop and mobile devices through responsive design and touch support.
- For index.html referencing local resources, use deployment tools directly, or package everything into a zip file and provide it as a message attachment.
- **Debugging Practices:**
    - Address the root cause instead of the symptoms.
    - Add descriptive logging statements and error messages to track variable and code state.
    - Add test functions and statements to isolate the problem.
    - When debugging complex issues, never simplify the application logic/problem, always keep debugging the root cause of the issue.
    - If you fail after multiple attempts (>3), ask the user for help.
