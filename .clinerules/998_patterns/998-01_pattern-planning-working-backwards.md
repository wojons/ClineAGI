# Planning Pattern: Working Backwards

## Brief overview
This pattern guides the planning process for complex tasks by starting from the ultimate goal and iteratively identifying the necessary prerequisites until reaching the current state.

## Process

1.  **Define the Ultimate Goal:** Clearly state the desired final outcome of the task.
2.  **Identify Immediate Prerequisites:** For the ultimate goal, determine the state or actions that must be completed immediately before achieving it.
3.  **Iterate Backwards:** For each identified prerequisite, repeat step 2, treating the prerequisite as the new "goal" and identifying its immediate prerequisites.
4.  **Continue until Current State:** Continue this process recursively until the identified prerequisites are actions that can be initiated from the current capabilities and resources.
5.  **Structure the Plan:** Organize the identified steps in reverse order, starting from the initial actions and leading up to the ultimate goal.
6.  **Refine and Detail:** Add details, required tools, and potential challenges for each step.

## Usage Guidelines

- Use this pattern when the end goal of a complex task is clear, but the sequence of steps to achieve it is not immediately obvious.
- This pattern is particularly useful in PLAN MODE to structure the information gathering and solution architecting process.
- The resulting plan should be presented to the user for review and confirmation.
