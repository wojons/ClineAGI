The merged patterns are organized into the following categories:

- **Summarize Content**: For generating concise summaries of various content types.
- **Analyze Content**: For analyzing and evaluating different types of content.
- **Create Content**: For generating new content, such as code, reports, and designs.
- **Extract Information**: For extracting specific data and insights from content.
- **Visualize Data/Concepts**: For creating visual representations of data and ideas.
- **Improve/Refine Content**: For enhancing and refining existing content.
- **Utility/Helper Tasks**: For performing general utility and helper tasks.

Each merged pattern file provides a general interface and goal, allowing Cline to apply the most relevant specific patterns based on the user's input and the nature of the content.
