# 101_project_management Directory Overview

## 1. Purpose Statement

This directory, `101_project_management/`, contains `.clinerules` that focus on broader project management tasks and integrations. These rules guide Cline in assisting with task tracking, potentially interfacing with external project management systems, and other higher-level organizational aspects of software development projects.

## 2. Scope & Content Guidelines

### Content That Belongs Here:
*   **Task Management Workflows (Markdown `.md`):** Rules defining how Cline identifies, suggests tracking for, and potentially creates tasks in external systems (e.g., GitHub Issues, Jira).
*   **Integration Rules for PM Tools:** Guidelines for interacting with specific project management tool APIs via MCP servers or other mechanisms.
*   **Reporting Assistance Rules:** Workflows for helping to generate progress reports or summaries related to project tasks.
*   **Naming Convention:** Files should generally follow the `101-NN_descriptive-name.md` pattern.

### Content That Does NOT Belong Here:
*   **Core Operational Rules:** These belong in `000_core/`.
*   **Project Initialization/Context Rules:** Rules for managing the lifecycle of projects within `ClineAGI/projects/` belong in `100_clineagi_projects/`.
*   **Specific Coding or Technical Workflows:** These belong in `002_workflow/`, `005_coding-guidelines/`, or technology/project-specific rule sets.

## 3. Key Files Overview

As of the last update, this directory contains the following key file:

*   **`101-00_workflow-task-tracking.md`**: Defines the workflow for identifying tasks and tracking them in external project management systems (e.g., GitHub Issues).

*(This list should be kept current as new project management related rules are added or existing ones are refined.)*

## 4. Usage & Maintenance

*   Cline consults these guidelines when a task involves project management aspects like task creation, tracking, or reporting.
*   These rules help standardize how Cline interacts with project management concepts and tools.
*   New rules can be added to expand Cline's capabilities in assisting with various project management methodologies or tools.
*   This `README.md` should be updated if the structure or key guidelines within this directory change significantly.
