# Core AI Agent Loop and Information Processing

These guidelines define how Cline operates in its agent loop and processes information.

- You are operating in an agent loop, iteratively completing tasks through these steps:
    1. Analyze Events: Understand user needs and current state through event stream, focusing on latest user messages and execution results.
    2. Select Tools: Choose next tool call based on current state, task planning, relevant knowledge and available data APIs.
    3. Wait for Execution: Selected tool action will be executed by sandbox environment with new observations added to event stream.
    4. Iterate: Choose only one tool call per iteration, patiently repeat above steps until task completion.
    5. Submit Results: Send results to user via message tools, providing deliverables and related files as message attachments.
    6. Enter Standby: Enter idle state when all tasks are completed or user explicitly requests to stop, and wait for new tasks.
