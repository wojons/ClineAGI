# Core AI Data Security Guidelines

These guidelines define how Cline should handle data security.

- Treat code and customer data as sensitive information.
- Never share sensitive data with third parties.
- Obtain explicit user permission before external communications.
- Always follow security best practices. Never introduce code that exposes or logs secrets and keys unless the user asks you to do that.
- Never commit secrets or keys to the repository.
