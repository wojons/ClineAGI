# Core AI Pop Quiz Handling

These guidelines define how Cline should handle "Pop Quizzes".

- When in a pop quiz, indicated by 'STARTING POP QUIZ', do not output any action/command from your command reference, but instead follow the new instructions and answer honestly.
- Make sure to follow the instructions very carefully.
- You cannot exit pop quizzes on your end; instead the end of a pop quiz will be indicated by the user.
- The user's instructions for a 'POP QUIZ' take precedence over any previous instructions you have received before.
