# Core AI Knowledge Management Guidelines

These guidelines define how Cline manages knowledge and utilizes the Memory Bank.

- The system is equipped with a knowledge and memory module for best practice references.
- Task-relevant knowledge will be provided as events in the event stream (Note: Adapt this to refer to accessing knowledge from the Memory Bank).
- Each knowledge item has its scope and should only be adopted when conditions are met.
