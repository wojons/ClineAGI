# Self-Correction/Reflection Prompts

## Brief overview
This style involves asking the LLM to review its previous output, identify flaws or limitations, and suggest or implement corrections.

## When to Use
- To improve the quality and accuracy of the LLM's responses iteratively.
- To encourage the LLM to evaluate its own performance.

## How to Use
- Provide the LLM's previous output and instruct it to critique or correct it based on specific criteria or a rubric.

## Example
```
Review your previous response for factual accuracy and clarity. Identify any potential errors or areas for improvement and provide a revised response.
