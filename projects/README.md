# Projects Directory

This directory, `projects/`, is a dedicated space within the main `ClineAGI` repository for housing individual user-specific projects, datasets, or specialized AGI applications.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this structure is to maintain a clear separation between the core `ClineAGI` system and the various projects that users might develop or manage using it. This modularity allows:
-   **Independent Development:** Each project within this directory should be its own independent Git repository. This means it will have its own `.git` folder, commit history, branches, and potentially its own remote repository.
-   **Customization:** Users can tailor projects to their specific needs without altering the core `ClineAGI` codebase.
-   **Non-Disruptive Updates:** The core `ClineAGI` system can be updated (e.g., via `git pull` in the parent `ClineAGI` directory) without overwriting or breaking the individual projects stored here, as these projects are managed as separate repositories.

## Management
-   **Git Repositories:** To add a new project, you would typically navigate into the `projects/` directory, create a new subdirectory for your project, `cd` into it, and then initialize a new Git repository (`git init`) or clone an existing one.
-   **`.gitignore` in Parent:** The main `ClineAGI` repository's `.gitignore` file should be configured to ignore the contents of these project sub-repositories (e.g., by ignoring `projects/*/` or `projects/*/.git` and `projects/*/*`). This ensures that project-specific files are not accidentally committed to the core `ClineAGI` repository. This `README.md` file itself should be tracked by the parent `ClineAGI` repository.

## Example Workflow
1.  Navigate to the `ClineAGI/projects/` directory.
2.  Create a new directory for your project: `mkdir my_new_project`
3.  Change into that directory: `cd my_new_project`
4.  Initialize it as a Git repository: `git init`
5.  (Optional) Add a remote for your project: `git remote add origin <your_project_remote_url>`
6.  Start developing your project.

This setup provides flexibility and ensures that your personal projects remain distinct from the core AGI development.
