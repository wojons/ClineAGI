# Design Directory Overview

## 1. Purpose Statement

This directory, `design/`, is intended to house materials related to the design, planning, and meta-level analysis of the ClineAGI system and its development process. This includes system logs (excluding project-specific or core reflection logs), design documents, architectural diagrams that are not part of the core `systemPatterns.md`, analysis reports generated by Cline, and other planning or research artifacts.

## 2. Scope & Content Guidelines

### Content That Belongs Here:
*   **`logs/` Subdirectory:** For storing various types of logs generated during Cline's operation or specific tasks. This can include:
    *   Task-specific execution logs.
    *   Debugging logs.
    *   Output from analysis scripts or tools.
    *   Records of significant system events or errors not captured elsewhere.
    *   *(Note: Core reflection logs like `raw_reflection_log.md` and `consolidated_learnings.md` belong in `memory-bank/`)*
*   **Design Documents:** Mockups, wireframes, UI/UX design specifications (if applicable and in a storable format).
*   **Architectural Diagrams:** Detailed diagrams or visual representations of system components or workflows that supplement the `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`.
*   **Analysis Reports:** Reports generated by Cline or by the user related to system performance, content analysis, or project audits (like the one we are currently working towards).
*   **Planning Artifacts:** Roadmaps, feature planning documents, or research notes that support the design and development process of ClineAGI itself.

### Content That Does NOT Belong Here:
*   **Core Operational Rules:** These belong in `.clinerules/`.
*   **Prompt Templates and Guides:** These belong in `prompts/`.
*   **Core System Context & Knowledge:** This belongs in `memory-bank/`.
*   **User Project Code or Data:** This belongs in the respective subdirectories within `projects/`.
*   **Raw User-Provided Intake Files:** These belong in `intake/`.

## 3. Current Key Subdirectories

*   **`logs/`**: Contains various operational and task-specific logs.

## 4. Usage & Maintenance

*   Files in this directory should support the planning, development, and understanding of the ClineAGI system.
*   The `logs/` subdirectory should be managed to prevent excessive accumulation of old or irrelevant log files if they are not needed for long-term analysis.
*   This `README.md` should be updated if the structure or primary purpose of the `design/` directory changes significantly.
