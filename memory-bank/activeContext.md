# Active Context: ClineAGI - Initial Setup

## 1. Current Work Focus
The primary focus is the initial setup of the ClineAGI project structure. This involves:
-   Creating the `memory-bank/` directory.
-   Populating the `memory-bank/` with the six core foundational documents:
    -   `projectbrief.md` (Completed)
    -   `productContext.md` (Completed)
    -   `systemPatterns.md` (Completed)
    -   `techContext.md` (Completed)
    -   `activeContext.md` (This document - In Progress)
    -   `progress.md` (To be created next)
-   Creating the `projects/` directory.
-   Creating a `README.md` file within the `projects/` directory to explain its purpose.

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions
-   **Decision:** The core Memory Bank files will be created with initial content reflecting the project's goals and structure as discussed.
-   **Decision:** The `projects/` directory will be established to house future, independent user project repositories.
-   **Observation:** The file creation process is proceeding sequentially.

## 3. Immediate Next Steps
1.  Complete the creation of this file (`activeContext.md`).
2.  Create `memory-bank/progress.md` with its initial content.
3.  Create the `projects/` directory.
4.  Create `projects/README.md` with content explaining its role for housing separate user project repositories.
5.  Consider creating a root `.gitignore` file for the `ClineAGI` project to exclude `projects/*/.git` and potentially `projects/*/` (while allowing `projects/README.md`). This will prevent the main repo from tracking the contents of sub-project repos.

## 4. Active Considerations & Questions
-   **Git Initialization:** The `ClineAGI` root directory is not yet a Git repository. This will be a necessary step, likely to be performed by the user or as a subsequent task for Cline.
-   **`.gitignore` Specifics:** The exact patterns for `.gitignore` need to be confirmed to correctly manage the `projects/` directory and its sub-repositories. A common pattern is to ignore all content in `projects/*/` but explicitly un-ignore necessary files like `projects/README.md` or specific project template files if any. A simpler approach might be to just ignore `projects/*/.git` and `projects/*/*` if the sub-repo directories themselves are not meant to be tracked once they contain actual projects. For now, the plan is to ignore `projects/*/` but ensure `projects/README.md` can be added.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences (Emerging)
-   **Structured Documentation:** Adherence to the Memory Bank structure is paramount.
-   **Iterative Creation:** Files and directories are being created step-by-step.
-   **Clarity of Purpose:** Each created file and directory has a clearly defined role.

## 6. Learnings & Project Insights (Initial)
-   The process of defining the Memory Bank files themselves helps solidify the project's initial scope and structure.
-   The separation of concerns between the core AGI and user projects is a key architectural principle from the outset.
