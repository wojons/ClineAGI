# Active Context: ClineAGI - Operational Framework Setup

## 1. Current Work Focus
The primary focus is on establishing and documenting the new operational framework for ClineAGI. This includes:
-   Initializing the local Git repository for `ClineAGI`. (Completed)
-   Connecting the local repository to the GitHub remote `wojons/ClineAGI`. (Completed)
-   Making the initial commit of the project structure and Memory Bank. (Completed)
-   Pushing the initial commit to the remote `main` branch. (Completed)
-   Updating the Memory Bank (`systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) to reflect:
    -   The Gitflow-like version control workflow.
    -   The concept of role-based operations (e.g., `ClineAGI-ADMIN`).
    -   The introduction of a `.clinerules` system for dynamic prompt management.
    -   The GitHub repository as the central source of truth.
    (This document update is in progress)

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions
-   **Decision:** The `ClineAGI` project will be version-controlled on GitHub at `wojons/ClineAGI`.
-   **Decision:** A Gitflow-like workflow will be adopted for core system changes.
-   **Decision:** Role-based operations and a `.clinerules` system will be implemented to manage Cline's context and behavior.
-   **Action:** Local Git repository initialized, remote added, initial files committed and pushed.
-   **Action:** `systemPatterns.md` and `techContext.md` updated to reflect these new systems.

## 3. Immediate Next Steps
1.  Complete the update of this file (`activeContext.md`).
2.  Update `memory-bank/progress.md` to reflect the establishment of the Git repository and the new operational framework.
3.  Discuss and define the specifics of:
    -   The `.clinerules` directory location (project-specific vs. global) and its internal structure (e.g., subdirectories per role).
    -   The definition and activation mechanism for roles.
    -   The primary development integration branch for Gitflow (e.g., `main` or `develop`).
    -   Naming conventions for task branches.
    -   The preferred process for reviewing and merging task branches.
4.  Create an initial task branch for these Memory Bank updates.
5.  Commit and push the Memory Bank updates to the new task branch.

## 4. Active Considerations & Questions
-   **`.clinerules` Location & Structure:** Clarification needed on whether `.clinerules` is project-specific (`/Users/lexykwaii/Code/ClineAGI/.clinerules`) or global (`/Users/lexykwaii/Documents/Cline/Rules`), and its internal organization.
-   **Role Definition & Switching:** How will roles be formally defined and how will I be instructed to switch between them?
-   **Gitflow Branching Strategy:** Confirm main integration branch (`main` vs. `develop`), task branch naming, and merge/review preferences.
-   **User Git Configuration:** The `git commit` output indicated that the user's Git name/email might not be configured globally. This is for the user to address if desired.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences (Emerging)
-   **Version Controlled Development:** All core changes will now follow a structured Git workflow.
-   **Explicit Operational Modes:** Roles will make operational contexts explicit.
-   **Document-Driven Development:** Memory Bank updates are integral to implementing new systems.

## 6. Learnings & Project Insights
-   Establishing a remote Git repository early provides a safety net and a central point for collaboration.
-   Formalizing workflows like Gitflow and concepts like roles adds necessary structure for a complex project like AGI development.
-   The `.clinerules` concept offers a powerful way to make my operations more adaptable and context-aware.
