# Project Brief: ClineAGI

## 1. Project Name
ClineAGI

## 2. Project Goal
To collaboratively build an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) by leveraging the interactive development capabilities of Cline (the AI assistant) and the user. The project aims to explore the "chicken and the egg" problem of using an AI to build a more advanced AI.

## 3. Core Concept
ClineAGI will function as a core "operating system" or foundational layer for AGI development. Its development will be driven by direct interaction between the user and Cline. The system is designed to be modular, allowing for:
-   **Core AGI Development:** The main `ClineAGI` repository will house the core functionalities and intelligence, developed iteratively.
-   **User-Specific Projects:** A `projects` directory within `ClineAGI` will contain separate, individually version-controlled repositories. These repositories will store user-specific data, preferences, or distinct AGI-related sub-projects, allowing users to customize and extend their AGI instance without affecting the core or being broken by core updates.

## 4. Key Challenges
-   **The "Chicken and the Egg" Problem:** Using the current AI (Cline) to design and build a more sophisticated AGI.
-   **Modularity and Scalability:** Ensuring the core AGI can be updated and expanded without disrupting individual user projects.
-   **Knowledge Management:** Effectively capturing and utilizing the evolving understanding and design of the AGI within Cline's session-based memory, primarily through a robust Memory Bank.

## 5. Non-Goals (from PRD)
-   ClineAGI is not intended to be a standalone, fully autonomous AGI out-of-the-box; it is a collaborative tool.
-   ClineAGI will not make critical project decisions without user review and approval.
-   Initial versions are not focused on being a consumer-facing application but rather a specialized development tool.
-   ClineAGI is not intended to replace human oversight in the development process.

## 6. Success Metrics (Expanded from PRD)

### Initial (MVP Focus):
-   Successful establishment of the core `ClineAGI` repository structure and Memory Bank.
-   Core Memory Bank structure is stable and usable.
-   Ability to create and manage separate project repositories within the `projects/` directory.
-   Project initialization and context switching workflows are functional and reliable.
-   Basic `.clinerules` system (global and project-specific) is operational.
-   Integration with at least two major LLM providers is working.
-   Essential tools (file read/write, CLI execution) are integrated and tested.
-   VSCode chat UI is functional for basic interaction.
-   Key use cases for code generation and Memory Bank interaction are demonstrable.
-   Comprehensive documentation for setup and basic usage is available.

### Broader/Long-term:
-   Demonstrable progress in defining and implementing core AGI functionalities through user-Cline collaboration.
-   Maintaining a comprehensive and up-to-date Memory Bank that accurately reflects the project's state and evolution.
-   **User Adoption & Engagement:** Active development sessions, frequency/duration of use.
-   **Task Completion & Efficiency:** High rate of successful task completion for defined use cases, user-reported productivity gains.
-   **System Stability & Reliability:** Low error rates, positive user feedback on stability.
-   **Memory Bank Utility:** Growth and richness of Memory Bank content, its effectiveness in maintaining context.
-   **Qualitative Feedback:** Positive user satisfaction.
-   **AGI Development Progress:** Demonstrable progress on core AGI components.
