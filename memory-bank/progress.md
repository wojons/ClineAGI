# Progress: ClineAGI - Operational Framework Established

## 1. Current Status
-   **Phase:** Operational Framework Setup.
-   **Overall Progress:** The initial project structure and Memory Bank are complete. The project is now version-controlled on GitHub (`wojons/ClineAGI`). New operational procedures (Gitflow, roles, `.clinerules`) are being documented in the Memory Bank.

## 2. What Works / What Is Built
-   `memory-bank/` directory with all six core documents created.
-   `projects/` directory with `README.md` created.
-   Root `.gitignore` file created.
-   Local Git repository initialized for `ClineAGI`.
-   Connected to GitHub remote: `https://github.com/wojons/ClineAGI.git`.
-   Initial project state committed and pushed to `origin/main`.
-   Memory Bank files (`systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, and this file `progress.md`) are being updated to reflect the new operational framework.

## 3. What's Left to Build (Immediate Scope)
-   Finalize updates to this `progress.md` file. (In Progress)
-   Create a new Git task branch for these Memory Bank updates (e.g., `feature/setup-operational-framework`).
-   Commit all Memory Bank changes to this new task branch.
-   Push the new task branch to the remote repository.
-   Discuss and define the specifics of:
    -   `.clinerules` directory location (project-specific vs. global) and internal structure.
    -   Role definition and activation mechanisms.
    -   Gitflow primary integration branch, task branch naming, and merge/review process.
-   Begin implementing the `.clinerules` system and role management.

## 4. Known Issues & Challenges
-   **The "Chicken and the Egg" Problem:** Ongoing conceptual challenge.
-   **Session-Based Memory:** Continuous reliance on an accurate and up-to-date Memory Bank.
-   **New System Implementation:** The Gitflow, roles, and `.clinerules` systems are new and will require careful implementation and refinement.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions & Learnings
-   **Decision (Previous):** Establish core Memory Bank and project structure. (Completed)
-   **Decision (New):** Implement Git version control with a remote GitHub repository (`wojons/ClineAGI`). (Completed)
-   **Decision (New):** Adopt a Gitflow-like workflow for core `ClineAGI` changes. (Documenting)
-   **Decision (New):** Introduce role-based operations (e.g., `ClineAGI-ADMIN`) to manage context and workflows. (Documenting)
-   **Decision (New):** Implement a `.clinerules` system for dynamic prompt and rule management. (Documenting)
-   **Learning:** Integrating version control early provides a robust foundation.
-   **Learning:** Formalizing operational procedures (Gitflow, roles) is crucial for managing the complexity of building AGI and for collaborative development, even with an AI.

## 6. Future Milestones (High-Level)
-   First functional prototype of a core AGI capability.
-   Successful creation and management of a sample user project within the `projects/` directory.
-   Demonstration of the core AGI updating without disrupting a user project.
