# Progress: ClineAGI - Integrating Community .clinerules & Finalizing Setup

## 1. Current Status
-   **Phase:** Operational Framework Enhancement & Documentation.
-   **Overall Progress:** Intake system and initial project-specific `.clinerules` established. Community-provided `.clinerules` (guidelines for writing rules) integrated. Memory Bank is being updated to reflect all recent additions.

## 2. What Works / What Is Built
-   Core Memory Bank, project structure, Git repository, operational framework documentation, project templating system setup. (Completed & Pushed to `feature/setup-operational-framework`)
-   `intake/` and `intake-archive/` directories created and gitignored. (Completed)
-   `.clinerules/` directory established with:
    -   `ClineAGI-ADMIN_rules.md` (initial version). (Created)
    -   `writing-effective-clinerules.md` (from intake). (Added)
    -   `community-clinerules-contributing-guide.md` (from intake). (Added)
-   `intake/prompts-main/` processed and archived. (Completed)
-   Memory Bank files (`systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, and this file `progress.md`) are being updated for these `.clinerules` additions.

## 3. What's Left to Build (Immediate Scope)
-   Finalize updates to this `progress.md` file. (In Progress)
-   Commit new `.clinerules` files and all recent Memory Bank updates to the `feature/setup-operational-framework` branch.
-   Push the updated `feature/setup-operational-framework` branch to the remote repository.
-   Continue discussions to define specifics for:
    -   Further `.clinerules` content and structure.
    -   Role definition and activation.
    -   Gitflow conventions (integration branch, task branch naming, merge process).
    -   Automated project creation workflow from template.
    -   Template update merge conflict strategy.
    -   `intake/` directory monitoring and processing logic.
-   Begin implementing the refined `.clinerules`, role management, and automation logic.

## 4. Known Issues & Challenges
-   **The "Chicken and the Egg" Problem:** Ongoing.
-   **Session-Based Memory:** Ongoing.
-   **New System Implementation:** All new systems (Gitflow, roles, `.clinerules`, templating, intake) require careful, iterative development.
-   **Template Content:** `wojons/ClineAGI-Project-Template` is empty.
-   **`.clinerules` Population:** Needs ongoing collaborative effort to build out comprehensive and effective rules for various roles and tasks.
-   **Intake Automation:** Logic for me to automatically monitor and process `intake/` files needs to be designed and implemented (guided by new `.clinerules`).

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions & Learnings
-   **Decisions (Previous):** Core structure, Git, operational framework, project templating, intake system, initial `.clinerules` for admin. (Established)
-   **Decision (New):** Integrate community-provided meta-rules (`writing-effective-clinerules.md` and contribution guide) into the project's `.clinerules` to guide our own rule development. (Implemented, documenting)
-   **Learning:** Leveraging existing best practices for rule creation (like those in `writing-effective-clinerules.md`) will be beneficial.
-   **Learning:** The `.clinerules` system is becoming a central piece for managing my behavior and knowledge application.

## 6. Future Milestones (High-Level)
-   First functional prototype of a core AGI capability.
-   Successful creation and management of a sample user project within the `projects/` directory.
-   Demonstration of the core AGI updating without disrupting a user project.
