# Progress: ClineAGI - Initial Setup

## 1. Current Status
-   **Phase:** Project Initiation & Foundational Setup.
-   **Overall Progress:** The core directory structure and initial Memory Bank documentation are currently being established.

## 2. What Works / What Is Built
As of this moment (initial setup):
-   The `memory-bank/` directory has been created.
-   The following Memory Bank files have been created with initial content:
    -   `projectbrief.md`
    -   `productContext.md`
    -   `systemPatterns.md`
    -   `techContext.md`
    -   `activeContext.md`
-   This document (`progress.md`) is currently being created.

## 3. What's Left to Build (Immediate Scope)
-   Creation of the `projects/` directory.
-   Creation of `projects/README.md` to explain the purpose and usage of the `projects/` directory.
-   Creation of a root `.gitignore` file for the `ClineAGI` project to manage how sub-repositories in `projects/` are handled by the parent Git repository.
-   Initialization of the `ClineAGI` root directory as a Git repository (likely a user task or a subsequent step for Cline).

## 4. Known Issues & Challenges
-   **The "Chicken and the Egg" Problem:** This is an overarching conceptual challenge noted in `projectbrief.md` and will influence ongoing development. No specific technical manifestation yet.
-   **Session-Based Memory:** Cline's reliance on the Memory Bank is a constant operational factor that must be managed through diligent updates to these documents.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions & Learnings
-   **Initial Decision:** The project will start with a clearly defined Memory Bank structure to ensure all critical information is captured from the outset. This decision was driven by the `memory-bank.md` guidelines and the nature of Cline's memory.
-   **Architectural Decision:** The separation of the core `ClineAGI` system from user-specific `projects/` (as independent Git repositories) was established early to promote modularity and independent evolution. This is documented in `systemPatterns.md`.
-   **Learning:** The act of creating these initial Memory Bank documents helps to clarify and solidify the project's foundational concepts and immediate next steps.

## 6. Future Milestones (High-Level)
-   First functional prototype of a core AGI capability.
-   Successful creation and management of a sample user project within the `projects/` directory.
-   Demonstration of the core AGI updating without disrupting a user project.
