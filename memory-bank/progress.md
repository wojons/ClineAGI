# Progress: ClineAGI - Project Templating & Framework Refinement

## 1. Current Status
-   **Phase:** Operational Framework Refinement & Project Templating Integration.
-   **Overall Progress:** Core operational framework (Git, GitHub, initial Gitflow concepts, roles, `.clinerules`) documented. Project templating system introduced and initial setup completed. Memory Bank is being updated to reflect these additions.

## 2. What Works / What Is Built
-   Core Memory Bank and project structure established. (Completed)
-   `ClineAGI` Git repository initialized, connected to `wojons/ClineAGI` on GitHub, initial commit pushed to `main`. (Completed)
-   `feature/setup-operational-framework` branch created and pushed, containing initial documentation for Gitflow, roles, and `.clinerules`. (Completed)
-   `wojons/ClineAGI-Project-Template` repository cloned locally to `ClineAGI/ClineAGI-Project-Template/`. (Completed)
-   Root `.gitignore` updated to exclude the local template source directory. (Completed)
-   Memory Bank files (`systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, and this file `progress.md`) are being updated to incorporate the project templating system.

## 3. What's Left to Build (Immediate Scope)
-   Finalize updates to this `progress.md` file. (In Progress)
-   Commit the `.gitignore` update and all Memory Bank updates (for templating system and framework refinements) to the `feature/setup-operational-framework` branch.
-   Push the updated `feature/setup-operational-framework` branch to the remote repository.
-   Continue discussions to define the specifics of:
    -   `.clinerules` directory location and structure.
    -   Role definition and activation mechanisms.
    -   Gitflow primary integration branch, task branch naming, and merge/review process.
    -   The precise workflow for creating a new user project from the template, including automation by ClineAGI.
    -   Merge conflict resolution strategy when updating projects from the template.
-   Begin implementing the `.clinerules` system, role management, and the automated project creation logic.

## 4. Known Issues & Challenges
-   **The "Chicken and the Egg" Problem:** Ongoing.
-   **Session-Based Memory:** Ongoing reliance on Memory Bank.
-   **New System Implementation:** Gitflow, roles, `.clinerules`, and project templating are all new systems requiring careful design and iterative implementation.
-   **Template Content:** The `wojons/ClineAGI-Project-Template` is currently empty and will need to be populated.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions & Learnings
-   **Decisions (Previous):** Core structure, Git setup, initial operational framework documentation. (Completed)
-   **Decision (New):** Introduce a project templating system using `wojons/ClineAGI-Project-Template` to standardize new project creation. (Implemented initial setup, documenting)
-   **Learning:** Adding a templating system enhances consistency and efficiency for managing multiple user projects.
-   **Learning:** The interplay between the core AGI, the template repository, and individual user project repositories requires careful consideration of Git workflows and automation logic.

## 6. Future Milestones (High-Level)
-   First functional prototype of a core AGI capability.
-   Successful creation and management of a sample user project within the `projects/` directory.
-   Demonstration of the core AGI updating without disrupting a user project.
