# Progress: ClineAGI - AGI Agent Prompting and Knowledge Organization

## 1. Current Status
-   **Phase:** AGI Agent Prompting and Knowledge Organization.
-   **Overall Progress:** Analysis of external AI prompts and research documents completed. Core `.clinerules` updated and new tech-specific rules and patterns created. Agent knowledge base and initial prompts created and organized within `.clinerules/`. Memory Bank documentation is being updated.

## 2. What Works / What Is Built
-   Analyzed CL4R1T4S prompts and research documents. (Completed)
-   Updated core communication, tool usage, planning, and data security guidelines. (Completed)
-   Created tech-specific rules for Next.js/Supabase, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI. (Completed)
-   Created planning patterns for structured research reports, working backwards, and fake CoT reasoning. (Completed)
-   Created agent knowledge base summary file (`.clinerules/000_core/000_agent_prompts/agent_knowledge_base_summary.md`). (Completed)
-   Created main agent loop prompt (`.clinerules/000_core/000_agent_prompts/agent_self_programming_main_loop_prompt.md`). (Completed)
-   Created working backwards planning prompt (`.clinerules/000_core/000_agent_prompts/agent_planning_working_backwards_prompt.md`). (Completed)
-   Created fake CoT reasoning prompt (`.clinerules/000_core/000_agent_prompts/agent_reasoning_fake_cot_prompt.md`). (Completed)
-   Moved agent knowledge base and prompt files to `.clinerules/000_core/000_agent_prompts/`. (Completed)
-   Updated `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` to reflect the new agent prompting and knowledge organization section. (Completed)
-   Updated `memory-bank/techContext.md` to include details about the advanced planning, reasoning, and verification techniques from the research. (Completed)
-   Updated `memory-bank/progress.md` to summarize the current status and completed steps. (Completed)
-   Refined core and tech-specific `.clinerules` based on insights from CL4R1T4S prompts and research. (Completed)
-   Updated `memory-bank/progress.md` to reflect the refinement of `.clinerules`. (Completed)
-   Updated prompting style files in `.clinerules/999_prompt_styles/` with more detailed guidelines and examples. (Completed)
-   Memory Bank files (`activeContext.md`, and this file `progress.md`) are being updated to reflect these changes.

## 3. What's Left to Build (Immediate Scope)
-   Finalize updates to this `progress.md` file. (In Progress)
-   Update `memory-bank/activeContext.md` to summarize the current work focus, recent changes, and immediate next steps.
-   Commit the latest changes to the memory bank files.
-   Continue developing prompts for specific agent tasks (e.g., code generation, self-verification).
-   Integrate the agent prompts and knowledge base into the ClineAGI operational loop.

## 4. Known Issues & Challenges
-   **File Editing Issues:** Encountered difficulties updating `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` using dedicated tools and command-line redirection. Used a fallback method to update the file.
-   **Integrating Agent Prompts:** Need to determine the best way to inject relevant knowledge base sections into agent prompts during execution.
-   **Managing Agent State:** Need to define how the agent's "CURRENT SELF-ASSESSMENT" state will be managed and updated iteratively.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions & Learnings
-   **Decision:** Analyze external AI prompts and research to inform AGI agent prompting and `.clinerules` improvements. (Implemented)
-   **Decision:** Organize agent knowledge base and prompts within `.clinerules/` as a prompt library. (Implemented)
-   **Learning:** External prompts and research provide valuable insights into diverse AI approaches and technical challenges.
-   **Learning:** Organizing knowledge and designing prompts are crucial for building a capable self-programming agent.
-   **Learning:** Encountered and worked around file editing issues, highlighting the need for robust fallback strategies.
-   **Learning:** Analyzing CL4R1T4S prompts provided specific, actionable guidelines for improving communication, tool usage, coding practices, and more.
-   **Learning:** Detailing prompting style guidelines is important for supporting less capable models.

## 6. Future Milestones (High-Level)
-   First successful execution of the AGI agent's main loop using the created prompts and knowledge base.
-   Implementation of agent self-verification mechanisms.
-   Demonstration of the agent performing a simple self-modification.
