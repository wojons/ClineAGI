# Progress: ClineAGI - Intake System, .clinerules Init & Framework Docs

## 1. Current Status
-   **Phase:** Operational Framework Enhancement.
-   **Overall Progress:** Project templating system documented. Information intake system (`intake/`, `intake-archive/`) created. Project-specific `.clinerules/` directory initialized with a basic `ClineAGI-ADMIN_rules.md`. Memory Bank is being updated.

## 2. What Works / What Is Built
-   Core Memory Bank, project structure, Git repository setup (local & remote `wojons/ClineAGI`), initial operational framework documentation (Gitflow, roles, `.clinerules` concepts) on `feature/setup-operational-framework` branch. (Completed)
-   `wojons/ClineAGI-Project-Template` cloned locally; `.gitignore` updated; Memory Bank updated for templating system. (Completed & Pushed to `feature/setup-operational-framework`)
-   `intake/` and `intake-archive/` directories created. (Completed)
-   `.gitignore` updated to exclude intake folders. (Completed)
-   `.clinerules/` directory confirmed/created. (Completed)
-   `.clinerules/ClineAGI-ADMIN_rules.md` created with initial content. (Completed)
-   Memory Bank files (`systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, and this file `progress.md`) are being updated for these new systems.

## 3. What's Left to Build (Immediate Scope)
-   Finalize updates to this `progress.md` file. (In Progress)
-   Commit new files (`.clinerules/ClineAGI-ADMIN_rules.md`) and all recent changes (`.gitignore`, Memory Bank updates for intake and `.clinerules`) to the `feature/setup-operational-framework` branch.
-   Push the updated `feature/setup-operational-framework` branch to the remote repository.
-   Continue discussions to define specifics for:
    -   Further `.clinerules` content and structure.
    -   Role definition and activation.
    -   Gitflow conventions (integration branch, task branch naming, merge process).
    -   Automated project creation workflow from template.
    -   Template update merge conflict strategy.
    -   `intake/` directory monitoring and processing logic.
-   Begin implementing the refined `.clinerules`, role management, and automation logic.

## 4. Known Issues & Challenges
-   **The "Chicken and the Egg" Problem:** Ongoing.
-   **Session-Based Memory:** Ongoing.
-   **New System Implementation:** All new systems (Gitflow, roles, `.clinerules`, templating, intake) require careful, iterative development.
-   **Template Content:** `wojons/ClineAGI-Project-Template` is empty.
-   **`.clinerules` Population:** Needs collaborative effort to build out comprehensive rules.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions & Learnings
-   **Decisions (Previous):** Core structure, Git, operational framework concepts, project templating. (Established)
-   **Decision (New):** Implement `intake/` and `intake-archive/` for structured information flow. (Implemented initial setup, documenting)
-   **Decision (New):** Initialize a project-specific `.clinerules/` directory and start populating it (e.g., `ClineAGI-ADMIN_rules.md`). (Implemented initial setup, documenting)
-   **Learning:** Addressing information flow (intake folders) and proactive rule creation (`.clinerules`) early will improve long-term efficiency.

## 6. Future Milestones (High-Level)
-   First functional prototype of a core AGI capability.
-   Successful creation and management of a sample user project within the `projects/` directory.
-   Demonstration of the core AGI updating without disrupting a user project.
