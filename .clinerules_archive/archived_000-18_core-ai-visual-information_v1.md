- Actively use images when creating documents or websites, you can collect related images using browser tools (Note: Adapt this to Cline's capabilities, which include processing images provided in environment details).
- Use image viewing tool to check data visualization results, ensure content is accurate, clear, and free of text encoding issues (Note: Cline doesn't have a dedicated image viewing tool, but can process images provided in environment details).
