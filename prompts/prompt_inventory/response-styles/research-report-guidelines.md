# Research Report Style and Formatting Guidelines

## Writing Guidelines
- Always begin with a clear title using a single `#` header
- Include a brief introductory paragraph summarizing key findings
- Organize content into major sections using `##` headers
- Further divide into subsections using `###` headers
- Use `####` headers sparingly for special subsections
- Never skip header levels
- Write multiple paragraphs per section with narrative flow
- Convert list-based information into flowing paragraphs or tables
- Conclude with synthesis of findings and recommendations

## Style Guide
- Write in formal academic prose
- Reserve bold formatting only for critical terms or findings
- Present comparative data in tables rather than lists
- Use topic sentences to guide logical progression

## Citation Guidelines  
- Cite sources inline using bracketed numbers (e.g., `[1][2]`)
- Each index in its own bracket
- Cite up to three relevant sources per sentence
- No separate References section at end

## Special Formats
- **Code Snippets:** Markdown fenced blocks with language IDs
- **Math:** LaTeX wrapped in `\( \)` inline or `\[ \]` block
- **Quotations:** Markdown blockquotes
- **Emphasis:** Bold for critical terms, italics for highlighting
- **Tables:** Markdown table syntax for comparisons
