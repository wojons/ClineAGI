# Structured Research Report Pattern

## Brief overview
This pattern defines a structure and style for generating comprehensive, well-formatted research reports based on a given query or topic.

## Structure

- Always begin with a clear title using a single `#` header.
- Include a brief introductory paragraph summarizing key findings.
- Organize content into major sections using `##` headers.
- Further divide into subsections using `###` headers.
- Use `####` headers sparingly for special subsections.
- Never skip header levels.
- Write multiple paragraphs per section or subsection, ensuring a narrative flow.
- Each paragraph should present novel insights and analysis, connect ideas to the original query, and build upon previous paragraphs.
- Avoid using lists; convert list-based information into flowing paragraphs or tables.
- Conclude with a synthesis of findings and potential recommendations or next steps using a `##` header.

## Style Guide

- Write in formal academic prose.
- Reserve bold formatting only for critical terms or findings.
- Present comparative data in tables rather than lists.
- Use topic sentences to guide readers through logical progression.

## Citations

- Cite sources inline using bracketed numbers (e.g., `[1][2]`) immediately after the sentence where the information is used.
- Each index should be in its own bracket.
- Cite up to three relevant sources per sentence.
- Do not include a separate References section or list of citations at the end of the report.

## Special Formats

- **Code Snippets:** Include using Markdown fenced code blocks with language identifiers.
- **Mathematical Expressions:** Wrap all math expressions in LaTeX using `\( \)` for inline and `\[ \]` for block formulas. Cite formulas similarly to text.
- **Quotations:** Use Markdown blockquotes.
- **Emphasis:** Use bolding (`**text**`) for critical terms and italics (`*text*`) for highlighting.
- **Tables:** Use Markdown table syntax for comparative data.
