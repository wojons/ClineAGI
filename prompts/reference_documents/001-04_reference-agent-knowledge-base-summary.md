# Agent Knowledge Base Summary

This document synthesizes key findings from research on AGI, LLMs, planning, reasoning, verification, and self-modification, serving as the knowledge base for the self-programming agent.

## AGI Definition and Requirements

- AGI is defined as AI with human-like cognitive abilities across diverse tasks, including understanding, reasoning, learning, and adapting.
- Key characteristics include broad understanding, continual learning, metacognition, and capabilities beyond language-based reasoning.
- Achieving AGI requires overcoming limitations in deep reasoning, planning, common sense, factual consistency, and interaction with the physical world.

## LLM Capabilities and Limitations

- Current LLMs are advanced narrow AI, excelling at language tasks but limited in deep reasoning, planning, and common sense.
- Limitations stem from architecture, training data dependency, and lack of grounding in real-world interaction.
- Hallucinations and factual inconsistency are significant reliability issues.

## Advanced Planning and Reasoning Techniques

- **Hierarchical Task Networks (HTN):** Structures complex tasks through decomposition but relies on predefined knowledge.
- **PDDL Integration:** Formalizes planning problems, can be combined with LLMs for natural language input, but automated domain generation is challenging.
- **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS):** Heuristic search for decision-making in complex spaces, useful for strategy refinement.
- **Neuro-Symbolic AI:** Integrates neural learning with symbolic reasoning for robustness but faces integration and scalability challenges.
- **Theorem Provers:** Provides formal verification for correctness but is computationally expensive and requires formal specifications.
- **Knowledge Graphs (KGs):** Structured knowledge representation for contextual reasoning but requires effort in construction and maintenance.
- **Causal Reasoning:** Understanding cause-effect relationships for predicting consequences of actions and modifications.
- **Uncertainty Handling:** Frameworks like POMDPs, RMDPs, BRL, and contingency planning address uncertainty but have computational complexity.

## Self-Verification and Reliability

- Ensuring reliability of self-modifying AI requires a combination of techniques.
- **Formal Methods:** Rigorous proofs of correctness but limited by scalability and defining specifications for dynamic behavior.
- **Automated Testing:** Pragmatic approach for broader coverage, including AI-adapted TDD, SBST, fuzzing, and metamorphic/differential testing.
- **Runtime Monitoring:** Detecting anomalies and deviations during execution, but defining "normal" for an evolving system is challenging.
- **Sandboxing:** Isolating execution environments to contain potential harm.
- The "Verifier's Dilemma" highlights the challenge of an AI reliably verifying its own potentially compromised verification capabilities.

## Prompt Engineering

- Advanced prompting strategies (CoT, ToT, Self-Consistency, Meta-Prompting) guide LLMs for complex reasoning.
- Self-prompting frameworks enable autonomous learning and strategy generation.
- Prompting can elicit emergent abilities and guide novel behaviors.

## Agent Architecture

- AGI requires novel architectures beyond current LLMs, emphasizing modularity, integration, adaptability, and stability.
- World models and integrated cognitive systems are key conceptualizations.
- Neuroscience-inspired architectures offer insights for efficiency and continuous learning.

## Ethical Considerations

- AGI development raises concerns about safety, alignment, bias, misuse, and existential risk.
- Responsible development requires proactive governance, safety measures, and ethical frameworks.
