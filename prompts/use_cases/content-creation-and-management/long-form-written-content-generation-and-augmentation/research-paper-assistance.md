# Use Case Definition: Research Paper Assistance

**Objective:** To assist a user in the process of writing a research paper by performing tasks such as summarizing literature, outlining methodologies, interpreting results, and drafting sections, while adhering to academic standards.

## 1. Core Requirements & Quality Indicators

*   **Accuracy & Rigor:**
    *   Information provided (summaries, interpretations) must be accurate and faithful to the source material.
    *   Methodological suggestions should be sound and appropriate for the research question.
    *   Assistance in drafting should maintain academic integrity.
*   **Understanding of Academic Conventions:**
    *   Familiarity with typical research paper structure (e.g., Abstract, Introduction, Literature Review, Methodology, Results, Discussion, Conclusion).
    *   Appropriate academic tone and language.
    *   Correct handling of citations and references (conceptual, AI can format based on provided data).
*   **Critical Analysis & Synthesis:**
    *   Ability to synthesize information from multiple sources for a literature review.
    *   Capacity to help interpret data or results provided by the user.
    *   Ability to identify gaps in research or potential areas for discussion.
*   **Clarity & Coherence:**
    *   Drafted sections should be clear, well-organized, and logically structured.
    *   Summaries should be concise and capture essential information.
*   **Supportive, Not Substitutive:**
    *   The AI's role is to assist and augment the user's research and writing process, not to conduct original research or be the primary author. Ethical considerations are paramount.

## 2. Key Stages & Processes Involved (AI Assistance Points)

1.  **Topic Refinement & Research Question Formulation:**
    *   Help user narrow down a broad topic or formulate a specific research question.
    *   Suggest keywords for literature searches.
2.  **Literature Review Assistance:**
    *   Summarize provided research articles or sources.
    *   Identify key themes, findings, and methodologies from a set of papers.
    *   Help organize literature into a coherent review structure.
    *   Identify gaps in existing literature.
3.  **Methodology Outlining:**
    *   Based on the research question, help outline potential research methodologies.
    *   Discuss pros and cons of different approaches (if provided with options by the user).
    *   Help structure the methodology section.
4.  **Results Interpretation Assistance (Based on User-Provided Data/Results):**
    *   Help describe and summarize quantitative or qualitative results provided by the user.
    *   Assist in identifying patterns, trends, or significant findings in the data.
    *   (Caution: AI should not perform statistical analysis itself unless specifically tooled and validated for it; focus is on articulating user-provided analysis).
5.  **Drafting Specific Sections:**
    *   Assist in drafting sections like the Introduction (background, problem statement, research question), Discussion (interpreting results in context of literature, limitations, future work), or Conclusion.
    *   Help articulate arguments or findings clearly.
6.  **Abstract Generation:**
    *   Based on a completed or near-complete paper, assist in drafting a concise and informative abstract.
7.  **Reference Formatting (Conceptual):**
    *   If provided with citation data and a style (e.g., APA, MLA), assist in formatting references.
8.  **Review & Feedback (On User's Drafts):**
    *   Provide feedback on clarity, structure, argumentation, and academic tone of user-written drafts.
    *   Identify areas for improvement or further development.

## 3. Inputs Required from User/System

*   **Research Topic/Question:** The central focus of the paper.
*   **Specific Task:** (e.g., "Summarize these articles," "Help outline the methodology for X," "Draft an introduction for Y").
*   **Relevant Source Materials:** Articles, data, notes provided by the user.
*   **Target Journal/Audience (Optional):** To tailor style and emphasis.
*   **Specific Formatting/Style Guidelines (Optional):** (e.g., APA, MLA).
*   **User's Own Drafts/Notes:** For review or incorporation.

## 4. Potential Challenges & Considerations

*   **Maintaining Academic Integrity:** Ensuring AI assistance does not cross into plagiarism or unethical research practices. The AI is a tool, not a co-author of original thought.
*   **Complexity of Research:** Deep, nuanced understanding of highly specialized fields may be beyond AI's current capabilities without significant user guidance and input.
*   **Original Contribution:** The core intellectual contribution must come from the user. AI assists in articulation and organization.
*   **Bias in Summarization/Interpretation:** AI summaries might inadvertently introduce bias or miss nuances. User review is critical.
*   **Over-Reliance:** Users must critically evaluate AI-generated content and not accept it unthinkingly.
*   **Data Security:** Handling potentially sensitive or unpublished research data.

## 5. Metrics for Success (How to Evaluate Output)

*   **Relevance to Request:** Does the AI's output directly address the specific assistance requested?
*   **Accuracy of Summaries/Interpretations:** Are source materials represented faithfully?
*   **Clarity & Coherence of Drafted Text:** Is the generated text well-written and easy to understand?
*   **Helpfulness of Suggestions:** Do outlines, feedback, or structural suggestions aid the user's process?
*   **Adherence to Academic Norms:** Is the tone, language, and (conceptual) structure appropriate for a research paper?
*   **Ethical Use:** Does the assistance support the user's work without compromising academic integrity?
