# Use Case Definition: Flash Fiction Creation

**Objective:** To generate an extremely brief, complete, and impactful piece of fictional narrative, typically under 1,000 words (often much shorter, e.g., 100-500 words), based on user-provided prompts or constraints.

## 1. Core Requirements & Quality Indicators

*   **Extreme Conciseness & Brevity:**
    *   The story is very short and every word contributes to the overall effect.
    *   No wasted words or unnecessary exposition.
*   **Completeness of Narrative (Implied or Explicit):**
    *   Despite its brevity, it should feel like a complete story, often with an implied beginning, middle, and end, or a significant moment captured.
    *   May focus on a single event, character, or idea.
*   **Impact & Resonance:**
    *   Aims to leave a strong impression or evoke a specific emotion or thought in the reader quickly.
    *   Often relies on suggestion, subtext, and a punchy or thought-provoking ending.
*   **Originality & Creativity:**
    *   Presents a fresh idea or a unique take on a common theme within the constraints.
*   **Character (Often Minimalist):**
    *   Characters might be sketched briefly but should serve their purpose within the narrative effectively.
*   **Focused Scope:**
    *   Typically centers on a single conflict, moment, or revelation.
*   **Adherence to Genre/Theme (if specified):**
    *   Effectively captures the essence of a requested genre or theme in a very compact form.
*   **Quality of Prose:**
    *   Well-crafted sentences and precise word choice are crucial due to the length constraint.

## 2. Key Stages & Processes Involved

1.  **Understand Core Prompt/Constraint:**
    *   Analyze user input for the central idea, character, setting, genre, or word limit.
2.  **Identify a Single, Potent Idea/Moment:**
    *   Flash fiction often revolves around one striking image, twist, character insight, or situation.
3.  **Outline (Mental or Brief):**
    *   Even for very short pieces, a sense of progression or a pivotal moment is needed.
4.  **Draft with Economy of Language:**
    *   Write directly and concisely.
    *   Focus on showing rather than telling, using vivid details sparingly but effectively.
    *   Imply background and context rather than explicitly stating it.
5.  **Craft an Impactful Beginning & Ending:**
    *   The opening needs to grab attention immediately.
    *   The ending often carries significant weight, providing a twist, resolution, or lingering thought.
6.  **Intense Revision & Editing for Brevity:**
    *   Cut every unnecessary word, phrase, or sentence.
    *   Ensure each remaining element serves a purpose.
    *   Check for pacing and impact.
    *   Proofread carefully.

## 3. Inputs Required from User/System

*   **Core Prompt/Seed Idea (Optional but helpful):** (e.g., "a story about a broken teacup," "a six-word story prompt: 'For sale: baby shoes, never worn.'").
*   **Genre (Optional):**
*   **Character Archetype/Detail (Optional):**
*   **Setting Element (Optional):**
*   **Specific Word Count Limit (Important for Flash Fiction):** (e.g., "under 300 words," "a drabble - exactly 100 words").
*   **Theme to Explore (Optional):**
*   **Desired Mood/Tone (Optional):**

## 4. Potential Challenges & Considerations

*   **Balancing Brevity with Story:** Telling a meaningful story in so few words is the primary challenge.
*   **Avoiding Abruptness:** Endings should feel impactful, not just sudden.
*   **Implying Depth:** Suggesting a larger world or deeper character motivations without explicit detail.
*   **Word Choice Precision:** Every word must be carefully chosen for maximum impact.
*   **Originality within Constraints:** Finding fresh angles for very short forms.

## 5. Metrics for Success (How to Evaluate Output)

*   **Impact:** Does the story leave a lasting impression despite its length?
*   **Conciseness:** Is it effectively brief and to the point?
*   **Completeness (Sense of):** Does it feel like a whole, albeit small, narrative?
*   **Clarity:** Is the story understandable?
*   **Originality:** Does it offer a creative or unique snippet?
*   **Adherence to Constraints:** Does it meet word count limits and incorporate user prompts?
*   **Craftsmanship:** Is the language precise and well-chosen?

## 6. Example Output Structure/Format
**Scenario:** User requests a flash fiction story under 100 words about a lonely lighthouse keeper who receives an unexpected message.
*   **User Input:**
    *   Theme: Loneliness and unexpected connection.
    *   Character: Old lighthouse keeper.
    *   Setting: Isolated lighthouse.
    *   Key Event: Receives a message in a bottle.
    *   Word Limit: Under 100 words.
    *   Mood: Melancholy, then hopeful.

*   **Cline Generated Flash Fiction:**

    The beam cut its lonely arc through the endless night. Seventy years, Thomas had watched it turn, a solitary sentinel. The sea only ever offered gulls' cries and the crash of waves. Tonight, though, it offered something more. A glint at the tide line. A bottle. Inside, a single, water-stained word on a scrap of parchment: "Hello." Thomas smiled, the first time in what felt like another seventy years. The beam suddenly seemed a little less lonely. (78 words)
