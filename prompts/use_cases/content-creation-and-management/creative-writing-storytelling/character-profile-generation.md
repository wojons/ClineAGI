# Use Case Definition: Character Profile Generation (Fiction)

**Objective:** To generate a detailed profile for a fictional character, outlining their physical appearance, personality traits, backstory, motivations, flaws, relationships, and other key attributes to aid in consistent and deep characterization in a story.

## 1. Core Requirements & Quality Indicators

*   **Comprehensive Details:**
    *   Covers a wide range of character aspects: physical, psychological, social, and historical.
*   **Internal Consistency:**
    *   Character traits, motivations, and backstory elements are consistent with each other and do not create contradictions.
*   **Believability & Relatability (even for fantastical characters):**
    *   Motivations and behaviors, even if extraordinary, stem from understandable human (or character-specific) desires, fears, or experiences.
*   **Potential for Conflict & Growth:**
    *   Profile includes flaws, internal conflicts, or false beliefs that can drive the character's arc and create story conflict.
*   **Uniqueness & Memorability:**
    *   Avoids overly generic or clich√©d character types unless specifically requested as a starting point.
    *   Includes distinctive details that make the character memorable.
*   **Actionability for Writer:**
    *   Provides a rich foundation for the writer to understand and portray the character consistently in various situations.
*   **Alignment with Story/Genre (if provided):**
    *   The character profile fits the tone, genre, and needs of the intended story.

## 2. Key Stages & Processes Involved

1.  **Understand Core Character Concept & Role:**
    *   Analyze user input: What is the character's basic idea? What role do they play in the story (protagonist, antagonist, mentor, sidekick)?
2.  **Brainstorm Physical Appearance:**
    *   Generate details about age, build, hair, eyes, distinguishing features, typical attire, mannerisms.
3.  **Develop Personality Traits:**
    *   List key positive and negative personality traits (e.g., brave, curious, impatient, arrogant).
    *   Consider Myers-Briggs type, Enneagram, or other personality frameworks if helpful conceptually.
    *   How do they generally behave in social situations? When alone? Under pressure?
4.  **Craft Backstory & History:**
    *   Outline significant life events that shaped the character: childhood, education, key relationships, formative experiences (triumphs and traumas).
    *   How does their past influence their present?
5.  **Define Motivations, Goals & Desires:**
    *   What does the character want most (consciously or unconsciously)?
    *   What are their short-term and long-term goals?
6.  **Identify Flaws, Fears & Internal Conflicts:**
    *   What are their major weaknesses or character flaws?
    *   What do they fear most?
    *   What internal struggles or contradictions do they experience? (e.g., desire for love vs. fear of intimacy).
7.  **Outline Key Relationships:**
    *   Describe their relationships with other important characters (family, friends, enemies, mentors, love interests).
    *   What is the nature and dynamic of these relationships?
8.  **Determine Skills, Abilities & Talents:**
    *   What are they good at? What skills have they acquired?
    *   Any special talents or powers (if genre-appropriate)?
9.  **Establish Beliefs & Values (Worldview):**
    *   What are their core beliefs about the world, themselves, and others?
    *   What do they value most? What is their moral code (or lack thereof)?
10. **Summarize in a Profile Format:**
    *   Organize all the generated information into a structured profile, often using headings for different categories.

## 3. Inputs Required from User/System

*   **Character Name (Optional):**
*   **Role in Story (Optional):** (e.g., protagonist, villain, love interest).
*   **Genre of Story (Optional):**
*   **Core Concept or Archetype (Optional):** (e.g., "a reluctant hero," "a cynical detective," "a naive idealist").
*   **Any Specific Traits, Backstory Elements, or Motivations to Include:**
*   **Relationship to Other Characters (if known):**
*   **Key Conflict They Will Face (if known):**

## 4. Potential Challenges & Considerations

*   **Avoiding Stereotypes:** Creating nuanced characters rather than flat archetypes.
*   **Balancing Strengths and Flaws:** Making characters relatable and human (or believably non-human) by giving them both positive and negative traits.
*   **Ensuring Motivations are Strong Enough:** Character goals need to be compelling to drive their actions.
*   **"Mary Sue"/"Gary Stu" Problem:** Avoiding characters who are overly perfect or capable without justification.
*   **Static vs. Dynamic Characters:** Profile should ideally allow for character growth (unless a static character is intended).

## 5. Metrics for Success (How to Evaluate Output)

*   **Depth & Detail:** Does the profile provide a rich and multi-faceted understanding of the character?
*   **Internal Consistency:** Are the character's traits, backstory, and motivations logically connected?
*   **Potential for Story:** Does the profile suggest interesting conflicts, relationships, and potential for character arc?
*   **Uniqueness:** Does the character feel distinct and memorable?
*   **Usefulness for Writer:** Can a writer use this profile to consistently and believably portray the character?
*   **Adherence to Prompt:** Does it incorporate all user-specified elements?
