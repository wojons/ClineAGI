# Use Case Definition: Screenplay Scene Generation

**Objective:** To generate a formatted screenplay scene, including scene headings, action lines, character names, and dialogue, based on user-provided plot points, character interactions, or thematic elements.

## 1. Core Requirements & Quality Indicators

*   **Standard Screenplay Format:**
    *   Adheres to industry-standard formatting for screenplays:
        *   **Scene Heading (Slugline):** INT./EXT. LOCATION - DAY/NIGHT (e.g., `INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY`).
        *   **Action Lines:** Descriptions of setting, character actions, and important visual/auditory details. Written in present tense.
        *   **Character Cues:** Character names in all caps, centered or offset before dialogue.
        *   **Dialogue:** Spoken lines by characters.
        *   **Parentheticals (Wrylies):** Brief notes in parentheses below character cue, before dialogue, indicating tone or brief action (used sparingly).
*   **Visual Storytelling:**
    *   Action lines effectively describe what the audience sees and hears.
    *   "Shows" rather than "tells."
*   **Natural & Purposeful Dialogue:**
    *   Dialogue sounds authentic for the characters and situation.
    *   Serves a purpose: advances plot, reveals character, or explores theme.
    *   Subtext is often present.
*   **Clear Scene Goal/Conflict:**
    *   The scene has a clear purpose within the larger narrative.
    *   Often involves some form of conflict or tension, even if subtle.
*   **Pacing & Flow:**
    *   The scene unfolds at an appropriate pace, with a clear beginning, middle, and end (for the scene itself).
*   **Character Consistency:**
    *   Characters behave and speak in ways consistent with their established personalities and motivations.
*   **Conciseness:**
    *   Action lines and dialogue are typically concise and impactful.

## 2. Key Stages & Processes Involved

1.  **Understand Scene Context & Purpose:**
    *   What is the goal of this scene? What needs to happen?
    *   How does it fit into the overall plot and character arcs?
    *   Which characters are involved? What are their individual goals within the scene?
2.  **Establish Scene Heading:**
    *   Determine if the scene is Interior (INT.) or Exterior (EXT.).
    *   Specify the LOCATION.
    *   Specify the Time of Day (DAY, NIGHT, DUSK, DAWN, etc.).
3.  **Draft Opening Action Lines:**
    *   Set the scene visually and introduce characters present.
4.  **Develop Action & Dialogue:**
    *   Write action lines to describe character movements, expressions, and significant environmental interactions.
    *   Craft dialogue that reveals character, advances the plot, and creates conflict or connection.
    *   Interleave action and dialogue naturally.
5.  **Build Scene to a Turning Point or Conclusion:**
    *   The scene should have a mini-arc, leading to a change, decision, revelation, or transition.
6.  **Format Correctly:**
    *   Ensure all elements (scene headings, action, character cues, dialogue, parentheticals) are formatted according to screenplay standards.
7.  **Review & Refine:**
    *   Read through for pacing, clarity, character consistency, and impact.
    *   Check for natural-sounding dialogue.
    *   Ensure action lines are visual and concise.
    *   Proofread.

## 3. Inputs Required from User/System

*   **Scene Premise/Goal:** What should happen in this scene?
*   **Characters Involved:** Names and brief descriptions or established traits.
*   **Setting (Location & Time of Day):**
*   **Key Plot Point(s) to be Addressed or Advanced:**
*   **Core Conflict or Interaction for the Scene:**
*   **Desired Mood or Tone for the Scene:**
*   **Specific Lines of Dialogue or Actions to Include (Optional):**
*   **Point in Overall Story (Optional):** (e.g., "This is the scene where X first meets Y").
*   **Approximate Desired Scene Length (Optional, in pages - 1 page ~ 1 minute):**

## 4. Potential Challenges & Considerations

*   **Visual Writing:** Thinking in terms of what can be seen and heard on screen.
*   **Subtext in Dialogue:** Crafting dialogue where characters mean more than they say.
*   **Pacing within a Scene:** Keeping the scene moving and engaging.
*   **Formatting Rigor:** Screenplay format is quite strict.
*   **Balancing Dialogue and Action:** Avoiding scenes that are too talky or have action without purpose.
*   **Originality:** Creating fresh and memorable scenes.

## 5. Metrics for Success (How to Evaluate Output)

*   **Correct Formatting:** Is the scene laid out according to standard screenplay conventions?
*   **Visual Clarity:** Can the reader easily visualize the scene from the action lines?
*   **Dialogue Quality:** Is the dialogue natural, purposeful, and character-appropriate?
*   **Scene Cohesion:** Does the scene have a clear focus and internal logic?
*   **Plot/Character Contribution:** Does the scene effectively advance the story or develop characters?
*   **Engagement:** Is the scene interesting to read?
*   **Adherence to Prompt:** Does it fulfill the user's specific requirements for the scene?
