## 2. Key Stages & Processes Involved

1.  **Understand Core Theme, Mood, Genre, & Structure:**
    *   Analyze user input: What is the song about? What feeling should it evoke? What musical genre is it for? Is there a desired structure (verse, chorus, bridge)?
2.  **Brainstorm Key Ideas, Images, & Phrases:**
    *   Generate concepts, metaphors, and specific lines related to the song's theme.
    *   Think about a central hook or memorable line for the chorus.
3.  **Outline Song Structure:**
    *   Map out the sections of the song (e.g., Verse 1, Chorus, Verse 2, Chorus, Bridge, Chorus, Outro).
4.  **Draft Lyrics for Each Section:**
    *   **Chorus:** Write the main, repeatable section that encapsulates the core message or emotion.
    *   **Verses:** Develop the story, provide details, or explore different facets of the theme.
    *   **Bridge:** Offer a contrast, a shift in perspective, or an emotional build-up.
    *   **Pre-Chorus (Optional):** Build anticipation for the chorus.
    *   **Outro/Coda (Optional):** Provide a sense of closure.
5.  **Develop Rhyme Scheme & Meter (if applicable):**
    *   Work on finding appropriate rhymes and maintaining a consistent rhythm or meter within sections.
6.  **Refine Word Choice & Imagery:**

    *   Strengthen imagery and figurative language.
7.  **Ensure Narrative/Thematic Flow:**
    *   Check that the lyrics progress logically and cohesively from one section to the next.
8.  **Read Aloud/Sing (Conceptual for AI):**
    *   Assess the singability and musicality of the lyrics by reading them with rhythm.
9.  **Revise & Polish:**
    *   Tighten phrasing, improve rhymes, enhance emotional impact, and proofread.

## 3. Inputs Required from User/System

*   **Key Phrases, Ideas, or Story Points to Include (Optional):**
*   **Rhyme Scheme or Meter Ideas (Optional):**
*   **Examples of Similar Songs or Artists (Optional):** For style reference.
*   **Target Audience (Optional):**

## 4. Potential Challenges & Considerations

*   **Forced Rhymes:** Sacrificing meaning or natural language for a rhyme.
*   **Clich√©s:** Using overused lyrical phrases or imagery.
*   **Singability:** Writing words that are awkward to sing or don't fit well rhythmically.
*   **Abstract vs. Concrete:** Balancing abstract emotions with concrete details and imagery.
*   **Melody (Beyond AI Scope):** Lyrics are only one component of a song; the melody is crucial and created separately. AI-generated lyrics should be flexible enough to be set to music.
*   **Repetition:** Using repetition effectively (e.g., in a chorus) without becoming monotonous.
