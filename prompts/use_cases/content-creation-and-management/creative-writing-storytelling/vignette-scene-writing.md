# Use Case Definition: Vignette/Scene Writing

**Objective:** To generate a short, focused piece of writing that captures a specific moment, character sketch, mood, or a single, self-contained scene, often as part of a larger work or as a standalone descriptive piece.

## 1. Core Requirements & Quality Indicators

*   **Focused Scope:**
    *   Clearly centers on a single moment, character interaction, setting description, or emotional beat.
    *   Avoids sprawling into multiple plotlines or complex narratives.
*   **Evocative Description & Imagery:**
    *   Uses vivid language and sensory details (sight, sound, smell, touch, taste) to immerse the reader.
    *   Paints a clear picture of the character, setting, or atmosphere.
*   **Emotional Resonance/Mood Creation:**
    *   Successfully establishes and conveys the intended mood or emotion (e.g., tension, joy, nostalgia, suspense).
*   **Character Insight (if character-focused):**
    *   Reveals aspects of a character's personality, motivations, or internal state through action, dialogue, or internal monologue within the scene.
*   **Atmosphere & Setting:**
    *   Effectively establishes the time, place, and overall feeling of the environment.
*   **Conciseness & Impact:**
    *   Delivers its impact efficiently, without unnecessary words.
    *   Every element contributes to the scene's purpose.
*   **Natural Dialogue (if applicable):**
    *   Dialogue sounds authentic for the characters and situation.
*   **Show, Don't Tell:**
    *   Relies on description, action, and dialogue to convey information and emotion rather than explicit exposition.

## 2. Key Stages & Processes Involved

1.  **Understand Core Focus & Purpose:**
    *   What is the central element of this vignette/scene? (A specific character, a setting, an event, an emotion, a relationship dynamic).
    *   What is this piece intended to achieve or convey?
2.  **Identify Key Sensory Details & Emotional Beats:**
    *   Brainstorm specific details that will bring the moment to life.
    *   Determine the emotional arc or core feeling of the scene.
3.  **Establish Point of View (POV):**
    *   Decide from whose perspective the scene will be told (e.g., first person, third person limited, third person omniscient).
4.  **Draft the Scene/Vignette:**
    *   **Opening:** Immediately establish the setting, character(s), or mood.
    *   **Development:** Build the scene through description, action, dialogue, and/or internal thought. Focus on sensory details.
    *   **Closing:** End with an image, thought, or line of dialogue that resonates or provides a sense of closure for the specific moment (even if the larger story continues).
5.  **Refine Language for Impact:**
    *   Choose precise verbs and evocative adjectives/adverbs.
    *   Pay attention to rhythm and pacing of sentences.
6.  **Ensure Consistency (if part of a larger work):**
    *   Maintain consistency with established character traits, plot points, and setting details from the broader narrative.
7.  **Review & Edit:**
    *   Check for clarity, vividness, emotional impact, and conciseness.
    *   Proofread.

## 3. Inputs Required from User/System

*   **Central Focus/Subject:** (e.g., "a character feeling anxious before a speech," "a description of a rainy city street at night," "a brief argument between two friends").
*   **Key Character(s) Involved (if any):** Names, brief descriptions, or established traits.
*   **Setting Details (if specific):** Time, place, atmosphere.
*   **Desired Mood or Emotion to Convey:**
*   **Specific Sensory Details to Include (Optional):**
*   **Plot Point to Illustrate (if part of a larger story):**
*   **Point of View (Optional):**
*   **Approximate Desired Length (Optional):** (Vignettes/scenes are typically short).
*   **Any Specific Objects, Actions, or Lines of Dialogue to Incorporate (Optional):**

## 4. Potential Challenges & Considerations

*   **Maintaining Focus:** Resisting the urge to expand beyond the intended scope of the single moment/scene.
*   **Balancing Description with Action/Dialogue:** Finding the right mix to keep the scene engaging.
*   **Showing vs. Telling:** A common challenge in descriptive writing.
*   **Creating Impact in a Short Space:** Making a brief piece memorable.
*   **Integration (if part of a larger work):** Ensuring the scene fits cohesively into the broader narrative.

## 5. Metrics for Success (How to Evaluate Output)

*   **Vividness & Imagery:** Does the writing create a strong mental picture or sensory experience?
*   **Emotional Impact/Mood:** Does it successfully evoke the intended feeling?
*   **Focus & Cohesion:** Does it remain centered on its core subject without straying?
*   **Character Revelation (if applicable):** Does it offer insight into the characters involved?
*   **Descriptive Quality:** Is the language precise and evocative?
*   **Conciseness:** Is the scene delivered without unnecessary padding?
*   **Naturalness (of dialogue, description):** Does it feel authentic?
*   **Adherence to Prompt:** Does it effectively address the user's specific request for the scene/vignette?
