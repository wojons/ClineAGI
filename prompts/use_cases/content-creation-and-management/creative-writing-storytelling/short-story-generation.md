# Use Case Definition: Short Story Generation

**Objective:** To generate an original short story based on user-provided parameters such as genre, theme, character archetypes, plot points, or specific constraints.

## 1. Core Requirements & Quality Indicators

*   **Originality & Creativity:**
    *   The story should be a novel creation, not a direct copy or minor variation of existing works.
    *   Demonstrates imaginative plot, characters, and setting.
*   **Coherent Plot & Structure:**
    *   Has a clear beginning, middle, and end (even if non-linear, the structure should be intentional).
    *   Events unfold logically (within the story's world) and contribute to the overall narrative.
    *   May include elements like exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution.
*   **Engaging Narrative:**
    *   Captures and holds the reader's interest.
    *   Creates suspense, emotion, or intrigue as appropriate for the genre.
*   **Well-Developed Characters (for their role):**
    *   Characters have believable motivations and behaviors within the story's context.
    *   Protagonist (if any) is compelling or serves their narrative purpose.
*   **Consistent Tone & Style:**
    *   Maintains a consistent tone (e.g., humorous, dark, whimsical) and writing style appropriate for the genre and story.
*   **Vivid Descriptions & Setting:**
    *   Uses descriptive language to create a clear sense of setting and atmosphere.
*   **Adherence to Genre Conventions (if specified):**
    *   If a genre is requested (e.g., sci-fi, fantasy, mystery, romance), the story incorporates typical elements and tropes of that genre effectively.
*   **Thematic Resonance (if applicable):**
    *   Explores or conveys a theme or underlying message if intended.
*   **Grammatical Correctness & Good Prose:**
    *   Well-written with correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation.
    *   Uses varied sentence structure and appropriate vocabulary.

## 2. Key Stages & Processes Involved

1.  **Understand User Prompts & Constraints:**
    *   Analyze all user inputs: genre, theme, characters, plot ideas, desired length, specific elements to include/avoid.
2.  **Brainstorm Core Concept & Plot Outline:**
    *   Develop a central idea for the story.
    *   Create a basic plot outline (beginning, rising action, climax, resolution).
3.  **Character Development (Basic):**
    *   Define key characteristics, motivations, and conflicts for main characters.
4.  **Setting the Scene (World-Building Lite):**
    *   Establish the time, place, and atmosphere of the story.
5.  **Drafting the Narrative:**
    *   Write the story section by section, focusing on:
        *   **Introduction:** Hooking the reader, introducing characters and setting.
        *   **Rising Action:** Building conflict and suspense.
        *   **Climax:** The peak of the action or emotional tension.
        *   **Falling Action & Resolution:** Winding down the story and resolving conflicts (or leaving them intentionally unresolved if appropriate).
    *   Incorporate dialogue, description, and action.
6.  **Maintaining Pacing & Flow:**
    *   Ensure the story moves at an appropriate pace.
7.  **Review & Revision:**
    *   Check for plot coherence, character consistency, and engaging narrative.
    *   Refine language, descriptions, and dialogue.
    *   Proofread for errors.

## 3. Inputs Required from User/System

*   **Genre (Highly Recommended):** (e.g., science fiction, fantasy, mystery, romance, horror, contemporary).
*   **Theme or Core Idea (Optional):** (e.g., "a story about betrayal," "exploring the meaning of courage").
*   **Key Character(s) (Optional):** Descriptions, archetypes, or names.
*   **Setting (Optional):** Time period, location, general atmosphere.
*   **Plot Points or Conflict (Optional):** Specific events or challenges to include.
*   **Desired Tone/Mood (Optional):** (e.g., lighthearted, suspenseful, melancholic).
*   **Approximate Length (Optional):** (e.g., "very short," "around 1000 words").
*   **Specific Elements to Include or Avoid (Optional):**
*   **Opening Line or Scene Idea (Optional):**

## 4. Potential Challenges & Considerations

*   **True Originality:** Avoiding clich√©s or overly familiar plotlines.
*   **Character Depth:** Creating believable and engaging characters in a short format.
*   **Pacing:** Effectively managing the story's progression within a limited word count.
*   **Satisfying Resolution (or intentional lack thereof):** Ending the story in a way that feels complete or appropriately open-ended.
*   **Emotional Impact:** Evoking the desired emotions in the reader.
*   **Show, Don't Tell:** Using actions, dialogue, and descriptions to convey information rather than direct exposition.
