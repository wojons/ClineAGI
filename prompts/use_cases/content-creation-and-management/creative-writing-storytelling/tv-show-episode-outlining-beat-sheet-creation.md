# Use Case Definition: TV Show Episode Outlining/Beat Sheet Creation

**Objective:** To generate a structured outline or beat sheet for a television show episode, detailing key plot points, character arcs, act breaks, and scene progression, aligned with the show's format and overarching season narrative.

## 1. Core Requirements & Quality Indicators

*   **Adherence to Episodic Structure:**
    *   Follows typical TV episode structure (e.g., Teaser, Act One, Act Two, Act Three, Act Four, Tag for a one-hour drama; or similar structure for sitcoms/other formats).
    *   Clearly defines act breaks and their cliffhangers or turning points.
*   **Plot Cohesion (A-Plot, B-Plot, C-Plot):**
    *   Outlines a clear main plot (A-plot) for the episode.
    *   May include one or more subplots (B-plot, C-plot) that are thematically or narratively connected.
    *   Ensures plots intertwine or resolve effectively within the episode.
*   **Character Progression:**
    *   Shows how main characters are challenged or develop within the episode.
    *   Character actions and decisions drive the episodic plot.
*   **Contribution to Season Arc (if applicable):**
    *   The episode's events contribute to the larger storylines of the season.
*   **Pacing & Tension:**
    *   The beat sheet or outline suggests appropriate pacing for the episode, building tension towards act breaks and a climax.
*   **Scene Breakdown (for Beat Sheets):**
    *   Lists key scenes in chronological order.
    *   For each scene: a brief description of the action, characters involved, and its purpose.
*   **Thematic Consistency:**
    *   The episode's themes align with the overall themes of the show.
*   **Show-Specific Tone & Style:**
    *   Reflects the established tone, style, and genre of the television series.

## 2. Key Stages & Processes Involved

1.  **Understand Show Bible & Season Arc:**
    *   Review information about the show's premise, main characters, established world, tone, and the current season's overarching plotlines.
2.  **Determine Episode's Core Concept/Goal:**
    *   What is the central story or problem this episode will address?
    *   How does it fit into the season's narrative?
3.  **Develop A-Plot, B-Plot (and C-Plot if applicable):**
    *   Brainstorm the main storyline for the episode.
    *   Develop secondary storylines that complement or contrast with the A-plot.
4.  **Outline Act by Act:**
    *   **Teaser:** Hook the audience, introduce an immediate conflict or mystery.
    *   **Act One:** Establish the episode's main problem/goal, introduce complications. End with a turning point.
    *   **Act Two:** Protagonist attempts to solve problem, faces more obstacles, stakes rise. End with a significant setback or new revelation.
    *   **Act Three:** Protagonist at a low point, new plan or approach, push towards climax. End with a major confrontation looming.
    *   **Act Four (or equivalent):** Climax of the A-plot, resolution of the main episodic conflict.
    *   **Tag/Epilogue:** Brief scene showing aftermath, setting up future episodes, or providing an emotional button.
5.  **Break Down Acts into Scenes (Beat Sheet):**
    *   For each act, list the sequence of scenes.
    *   For each scene (beat):
        *   Scene heading (INT./EXT. LOCATION - TIME)
        *   Characters present
        *   Brief (1-2 sentence) description of what happens and the scene's purpose.
6.  **Integrate Subplots:**
    *   Weave B-plot and C-plot scenes into the acts, ensuring they have their own mini-arcs and connect to the A-plot or themes.
7.  **Track Character Arcs within the Episode:**
    *   Note how characters are challenged and how they react or change.
8.  **Review for Pacing, Cohesion, and Impact:**
    *   Ensure the episode has a good rhythm and builds effectively.
    *   Check that all plotlines are resolved satisfactorily (for the episode) or set up for future continuation.

## 3. Inputs Required from User/System

*   **Show Premise/Logline:**

*   **Specific Idea or Conflict for This Episode:**
*   **A-Plot and B-Plot Ideas (if user has them):**
*   **Desired Episode Format/Length:** (e.g., 30-minute sitcom, 60-minute drama, number of acts).
*   **Any Established Show Tropes, Running Gags, or Stylistic Elements to Include:**
*   **Point in the Season (Optional):** (e.g., "mid-season episode," "season finale setup").

## 4. Potential Challenges & Considerations
