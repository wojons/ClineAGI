# Use Case Definition: Role-Playing Game (RPG) Scenario/Encounter Design

**Objective:** To design a self-contained scenario or encounter for a tabletop or computer role-playing game, including setting description, involved NPCs, potential challenges (combat, social, puzzle), player objectives, and possible outcomes or rewards.

## 1. Core Requirements & Quality Indicators

*   **Clear Objective(s) for Players:**
    *   Players understand what they are supposed to achieve in the scenario/encounter.
*   **Engaging Premise & Hook:**
    *   The scenario starts with an interesting situation or problem that draws players in.
*   **Appropriate Challenge:**
    *   The difficulty of challenges (combat, puzzles, social interactions) is suitable for the intended player characters' level and abilities.
    *   Offers a sense of risk and accomplishment.
*   **Multiple Avenues for Success (Often):**
    *   Good encounters often allow players to use different skills or approaches to succeed (e.g., combat, stealth, diplomacy, clever thinking).
*   **Interesting NPCs:**
    *   Non-Player Characters involved have believable motivations, personalities, and potential reactions to player actions.
*   **Vivid Setting Description:**
    *   The location of the encounter is described clearly, perhaps with tactically relevant features for combat or interactive elements for puzzles/social encounters.
*   **Meaningful Consequences & Rewards:**
    *   Player actions within the encounter have consequences.
    *   Successful completion yields appropriate rewards (experience, items, information, reputation).
*   **Integration with Larger Campaign/World (if applicable):**
    *   The encounter fits thematically and narratively within the broader game world or campaign story.
*   **Clarity for Game Master (GM)/Developer:**
    *   The design is presented in a way that a GM can easily run it, or a developer can implement it.

## 2. Key Stages & Processes Involved

1.  **Define Encounter Goal & Context:**
    *   What is the purpose of this encounter in the larger adventure or campaign?
    *   What type of encounter is it (combat, social, exploration, puzzle, trap)?
2.  **Establish Setting & Atmosphere:**
    *   Describe the location, time of day, weather, and overall mood.
    *   Note any tactically important features or interactive elements.
3.  **Design NPCs/Antagonists:**
    *   Who are the key NPCs or creatures involved?
    *   What are their motivations, goals, abilities, and tactics?
    *   How might they react to different player approaches?
4.  **Outline Player Objectives & Potential Challenges:**
    *   What do the players need to do to "succeed"?
    *   What obstacles stand in their way? (e.g., monsters to fight, a riddle to solve, an NPC to persuade, a trap to disarm).
5.  **Develop Potential Resolutions & Outcomes:**
    *   What happens if players succeed? What if they fail?
    *   Are there partial successes or mixed outcomes?
6.  **Determine Rewards:**
    *   What do players gain from overcoming the encounter (e.g., treasure, information, experience points, story progression)?
7.  **Write Descriptive Text & GM Notes:**
    *   Draft text to be read or paraphrased by the GM to set the scene.
    *   Include notes for the GM on NPC behavior, triggers for events, or hidden information.
8.  **Consider Player Agency & Different Approaches:**
    *   Think about how players might try to tackle the encounter in unexpected ways and how NPCs/the environment might react.
9.  **Structure the Encounter Design:**
    *   Organize information clearly with headings for Setting, NPCs, Objectives, Challenges, Outcomes, Rewards, GM Notes.

## 3. Inputs Required from User/System

*   **RPG System/Ruleset (Optional but helpful):** (e.g., D&D 5e, Pathfinder, Call of Cthulhu) - influences monster stats, skill checks, etc.
*   **Party Level/Capabilities (Approximate):**
*   **Encounter Type Desired:** (e.g., "a challenging combat encounter," "a social intrigue scene," "a puzzle room").
*   **Setting/Location Idea:**
*   **Key NPCs or Monster Types to Include (Optional):**
*   **Connection to Ongoing Campaign/Story (if any):**
*   **Desired Tone/Mood:** (e.g., tense, humorous, horrific).
*   **Reward Ideas (Optional):**

## 4. Potential Challenges & Considerations

*   **Balancing Difficulty:** Making encounters challenging but not impossible or trivial.
*   **Player Agency:** Designing encounters that don't feel like a railroad, allowing for player creativity.
*   **"Solving" Social/Puzzle Encounters:** Creating non-combat encounters that are engaging and have clear (but not necessarily easy) solutions.
*   **GM Fiat vs. Player Choice:** Ensuring outcomes feel like a result of player actions and dice rolls, not just GM whim.
*   **Time Management (for GMs):** Designing encounters that can be run within a reasonable session time.
*   **Scalability (if for various party sizes/levels):**

## 5. Metrics for Success (How to Evaluate Output)

*   **Clarity & Completeness for GM/Developer:** Is all necessary information provided to run/implement the encounter?
*   **Engagement Potential:** Does the scenario sound fun and interesting for players?
*   **Appropriate Challenge Level (Conceptual):** Does the difficulty seem right for the target players?
*   **Plausibility of NPC Actions/Motivations:**
*   **Variety of Potential Solutions (if applicable):** Does it allow for different player approaches?
*   **Meaningful Outcomes & Rewards:**
*   **World/Campaign Consistency:** Does it fit the established game setting and narrative?
*   **Originality/Creativity:** Does it offer a fresh or memorable encounter idea?

## 6. Example Output Structure/Format
**Scenario:** User wants a D&D 5e combat encounter for a party of 3 level 5 adventurers in a ruined shrine.
*   **User Input:**
    *   RPG System: D&D 5e
    *   Party: 3 players, Level 5
    *   Encounter Type: Combat with a small puzzle/trap element.
    *   Setting: Ruined shrine in a swamp.
    *   Enemies: Undead, perhaps a minor spellcaster.
    *   Mood: Creepy, dangerous.

*   **Cline Generated RPG Encounter Design (Excerpt):**

    **Encounter: The Sunken Shrine of Sylas**

    *   **Setting:**
        *   The encounter takes place in the partially flooded main chamber of a small, ruined shrine. Crumbling stone walls are slick with algae. Murky water, about 2 feet deep, covers most of the floor (difficult terrain).
        *   A central dais rises slightly above the water, upon which sits a moss-covered stone altar.
        *   Three crumbling pillars offer partial cover.
        *   **Trap/Puzzle:** The altar has a hidden pressure plate. If stepped on (DC 13 Perception to spot, DC 15 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) to disable), or if a heavy object is removed from it, spectral hands erupt from the water, attempting to grapple (DC 12 Strength save to avoid) anyone in the water for 1d4 rounds.
    *   **NPCs/Antagonists:**
        1.  **Ghast (1):** Lurks behind the altar, initially hidden (DC 14 Perception to spot). It will try to use its Stench ability and then target weaker-looking PCs.
        2.  **Zombies (3):** Submerged in the murky water, they rise and attack when PCs enter the chamber or the Ghast attacks.
        3.  **(Optional) Will-o'-Wisp (1):** If the fight is too easy, it flickers into existence near a pillar, trying to lure a PC into a deeper, more treacherous part of the water or onto the altar trap.
    *   **Player Objectives:**
        *   Defeat the undead.
        *   (Optional) Discover a clue or item on the altar.
    *   **Challenges:**
        *   Combat with Ghast and Zombies in difficult terrain.
        *   Ghast's Stench and Paralyzing Touch.
        *   The pressure plate trap on the altar.
        *   Potential misdirection by Will-o'-Wisp.
    *   **Potential Resolutions & Outcomes:**
        *   **Success:** Undead are defeated. Trap is avoided or overcome. Players can safely investigate the altar.
        *   **Partial Success:** Undead defeated, but someone triggered the trap and suffered its effects.
        *   **Failure:** Party is overwhelmed (TPK or forced retreat).
    *   **Rewards:**
        *   XP for defeated monsters.
        *   On the altar, a small, waterlogged pouch containing 35 gp and a tarnished silver locket (non-magical but could be a plot hook).
        *   If the trap was disabled or cleverly bypassed, perhaps an inspiration point.
    *   **GM Notes:**
        *   Emphasize the creepy atmosphere, the smell of decay, and the unsettling sounds of the swamp.
        *   The Zombies are slow but relentless. The Ghast is more cunning.
        *   If players search the altar after the fight, they find the pouch. If they triggered the trap, the pouch might be partially submerged or harder to find.
