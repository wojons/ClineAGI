# Use Case Definition: Video Game Quest/Mission Scripting

**Objective:** To design and write the narrative script for a video game quest or mission, including objectives, key events, character dialogue, player choices (if applicable), and potential outcomes.

## 1. Core Requirements & Quality Indicators

*   **Clear Objectives & Goals:**
    *   The quest/mission has clear, understandable objectives for the player.
*   **Engaging Narrative & Premise:**
    *   The quest has an interesting setup or story hook that motivates the player.
*   **Logical Progression of Events:**
    *   Steps and events within the quest flow logically and contribute to achieving the objectives.
*   **Character Integration & Dialogue:**
    *   Relevant Non-Player Characters (NPCs) are involved with believable motivations and dialogue.
    *   Player character dialogue choices (if any) are meaningful.
*   **Player Agency (if applicable):**
    *   If the quest involves player choices, these choices have tangible consequences or lead to different paths/outcomes.
*   **Gameplay Integration (Conceptual):**
    *   The narrative script supports and integrates with expected gameplay mechanics (e.g., combat, exploration, puzzle-solving). AI describes narrative elements that imply gameplay.
*   **Pacing & Tension:**
    *   The quest is paced well, building tension or excitement as appropriate.
*   **Rewards & Resolution:**
    *   The quest offers a satisfying resolution and appropriate rewards (narrative or conceptual gameplay rewards).
*   **Clarity for Implementation:**
    *   The script is written in a way that is clear for game designers and developers to implement (e.g., clear triggers for events, dialogue conditions).
*   **World Consistency:**
    *   The quest and its elements are consistent with the established lore, setting, and tone of the game world.

## 2. Key Stages & Processes Involved

1.  **Understand Quest Context & Game World:**
    *   Review overall game narrative, setting, key characters, and existing lore.
    *   Determine how this quest fits into the larger game progression or story.
2.  **Define Quest Premise & Objectives:**
    *   What is the core idea or problem of the quest?
    *   What must the player achieve to complete it?
3.  **Outline Key Quest Steps/Beats:**
    *   Break the quest down into a sequence of major steps or events from initiation to completion.
4.  **Identify Key NPCs & Their Roles:**
    *   Which NPCs will give the quest, provide information, act as antagonists, or assist the player?
5.  **Draft Dialogue for NPCs & Player (if applicable):**
    *   Write dialogue for key interactions.
    *   If player has dialogue choices, draft those options and potential NPC responses.
6.  **Describe Key Events & Player Actions:**
    *   Write narrative descriptions of what happens at each step, including required player actions or triggers for progression.
7.  **Incorporate Player Choices & Branching Paths (if any):**
    *   If the quest has multiple paths or outcomes based on player decisions, outline these branches.
8.  **Define Quest Rewards & Consequences:**
    *   What does the player gain upon completion?
    *   Are there any lasting consequences in the game world?
9.  **Structure the Quest Script:**
    *   Organize the information clearly, often using a format that includes:
        *   Quest Title & Giver
        *   Prerequisites
        *   Objectives (listed)
        *   Step-by-step breakdown (Location, NPCs, Dialogue, Player Action, Outcome/Next Step)
        *   Completion Conditions
        *   Rewards
10. **Review for Playability, Engagement, and Clarity:**
    *   Read through from a player's perspective. Is it fun? Is it clear what to do?
    *   Check for plot holes or logical inconsistencies.

## 3. Inputs Required from User/System

*   **Game Setting & Lore Overview:**
*   **Main Player Character Archetype/Abilities (General):**
*   **Quest Idea/Premise:** (e.g., "a rescue mission," "a fetch quest with a twist," "a mystery to solve").
*   **Key NPCs to Involve (Optional):**
*   **Desired Location(s) for the Quest (Optional):**
*   **Type of Gameplay Expected (Optional):** (e.g., combat-heavy, puzzle-focused, dialogue-driven).
*   **Desired Quest Length/Complexity (Optional):**
*   **Connection to Main Story or Other Quests (if any):**
*   **Reward Ideas (Optional):**

## 4. Potential Challenges & Considerations

*   **Balancing Narrative with Gameplay:** Ensuring the story enhances gameplay rather than hindering it.
*   **Player Freedom vs. Scripted Events:** Managing player agency within a structured quest.
*   **Creating Meaningful Choices:** If choices are offered, they should feel impactful.
*   **Avoiding Repetitive Quest Structures:** ("Fetch X items," "Kill Y enemies").
*   **Clarity of Objectives:** Players can get frustrated if they don't know what to do.
*   **Technical Implementation (Beyond AI Scope):** AI drafts the narrative; actual coding of quest logic, triggers, and NPC behavior is a development task.

## 5. Metrics for Success (How to Evaluate Output)

*   **Clarity of Objectives & Steps:** Can a player (and developer) understand what needs to be done?
*   **Engagement Potential:** Does the quest sound interesting and motivating to play?
*   **Narrative Cohesion:** Does the quest tell a coherent mini-story?
*   **Character Believability (NPCs):** Do NPC motivations and dialogue make sense?
*   **Gameplay Integration (Conceptual):** Does the narrative support plausible gameplay interactions?
*   **World Consistency:** Does it fit the established game world?
*   **Completeness of Script:** Does it provide enough detail for a designer/writer to flesh out?
*   **Originality/Creativity:** Does it offer a fresh or engaging quest idea?
