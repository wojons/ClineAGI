# Use Case Definition: Playwriting Act/Scene Structure

**Objective:** To outline the act and scene structure for a stage play, detailing the progression of plot, character development, and thematic exploration within the conventional formatting of theatrical scripts.

## 1. Core Requirements & Quality Indicators

*   **Adherence to Play Structure:**
    *   Typically organized into Acts (e.g., One-Act, Two-Act, Three-Act, Five-Act structures).
    *   Each Act is broken down into Scenes.
    *   Clear delineation of where acts and scenes begin and end.
*   **Plot Progression:**
    *   Each scene and act contributes to the overall advancement of the plot.
    *   Includes exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution, distributed appropriately across the acts.
*   **Character Development:**
    *   Shows how characters evolve, face conflicts, and make decisions within scenes and across acts.
*   **Thematic Exploration:**
    *   The structure allows for the introduction and development of the play's central themes.
*   **Dramatic Tension & Pacing:**
    *   The outline suggests how tension is built and released throughout the play.
    *   Act breaks often occur at moments of high tension or significant turning points.
*   **Stageability (Conceptual):**
    *   While AI generates text, the scene descriptions should imply actions and settings that are conceivable on a stage.
*   **Clarity for Playwright:**
    *   Provides a clear roadmap for writing the full script, including dialogue and detailed stage directions.

## 2. Key Stages & Processes Involved

1.  **Understand Core Premise, Characters, and Conflict:**
    *   Analyze the user's concept for the play: central story, main characters, core conflict, themes.
2.  **Determine Overall Act Structure:**
    *   Decide on the number of acts (e.g., a traditional three-act structure, or a more contemporary two-act or one-act structure).
3.  **Outline Each Act:**
    *   For each Act:
        *   Define its primary function in the narrative (e.g., Act I: Setup & Inciting Incident; Act II: Confrontation & Rising Action; Act III: Climax & Resolution).
        *   Identify key plot points and character developments that must occur within that act.
        *   Determine the emotional arc of the act.
4.  **Break Down Acts into Scenes:**
    *   For each Act, list the sequence of scenes.
    *   For each Scene:
        *   **Setting:** Briefly describe the location and time.
        *   **Characters Present:**
        *   **Scene Objective:** What is the main purpose of this scene? What must be achieved or revealed?
        *   **Key Action/Events:** Summarize what happens in the scene.
        *   **Conflict:** What is the central conflict or tension in this scene?
        *   **Character Development:** How does this scene impact the characters involved?
        *   **Scene Ending:** How does the scene conclude and transition to the next? (Often a mini-cliffhanger or turning point).
5.  **Integrate Subplots & Themes:**
    *   Weave any subplots through the scene structure.
    *   Ensure scenes contribute to exploring the play's themes.
6.  **Consider Pacing and Rhythm:**
    *   Vary scene length and intensity to create a dynamic theatrical experience.
7.  **Review Overall Structure:**
    *   Check for logical flow, consistent character arcs, effective build-up of dramatic tension, and a satisfying overall narrative structure.

## 3. Inputs Required from User/System

*   **Play Concept/Logline:** The core idea of the play.
*   **Main Character(s) & Their Goals/Conflicts:**
*   **Central Theme(s):**
*   **Desired Act Structure (Optional):** (e.g., "a three-act play").
*   **Key Plot Points or Moments to Include:**
*   **Setting Ideas (if any):**
*   **Intended Genre/Style:** (e.g., comedy, drama, tragedy, farce).
*   **Target Audience (Optional):**

## 4. Potential Challenges & Considerations

*   **Stagecraft Limitations:** Playwriting must consider the practicalities of stage production (e.g., number of locations, feasibility of actions). AI outlines should be mindful of this conceptually.
*   **Dialogue as Primary Driver:** Much of a play is conveyed through dialogue; the outline sets the stage for this.
*   **Pacing for a Live Audience:** Maintaining audience engagement in a live theatrical setting.
*   **Unity of Time, Place, Action (Classical Ideals - Optional):** Some play structures adhere to these; others break them.
*   **Subtext:** Effective plays often rely heavily on subtext in dialogue and action, which an outline can only hint at.

## 5. Metrics for Success (How to Evaluate Output)

*   **Structural Soundness:** Is the act and scene breakdown logical and conventional for a play?
*   **Plot Cohesion & Progression:** Does the outline clearly show how the story unfolds and builds?
*   **Character Arc Clarity:** Is character development evident within the structure?
*   **Dramatic Potential:** Does the outline suggest opportunities for compelling conflict and tension?
*   **Thematic Integration:** Are themes woven into the proposed structure?
*   **Actionability for Playwright:** Does it provide a strong foundation for writing the script?
*   **Clarity of Scene Objectives:** Is the purpose of each scene clear?
