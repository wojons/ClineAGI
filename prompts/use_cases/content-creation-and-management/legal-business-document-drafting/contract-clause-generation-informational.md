# Use Case Definition: Contract Clause Generation (Informational Only)

**Objective:** To generate sample contract clauses for common legal or business situations, based on user-provided parameters. **Crucially, this is for informational and illustrative purposes ONLY and does NOT constitute legal advice. Users MUST consult with a qualified legal professional before using or relying on any generated clauses.**

## 1. Core Requirements & Quality Indicators

*   **Relevance to Request:**
    *   The generated clause addresses the specific situation or type of agreement described by the user.
*   **Clarity & Precision of Language:**
    *   Uses clear, unambiguous legal or business terminology appropriate for the clause type.
*   **Commonly Accepted Phrasing (General):**
    *   Reflects typical language and structure found in standard agreements for the described purpose, without claiming to be jurisdictionally perfect or universally applicable.
*   **Identification of Key Elements:**
    *   Includes essential components typically found in such a clause (e.g., for a confidentiality clause: definition of confidential information, obligations of recipient, duration, exclusions).
*   **Neutrality (Usually):**
    *   Often aims for balanced or standard phrasing, unless a specific bias (e.g., "pro-seller" or "pro-buyer") is requested for illustrative purposes.
*   **Prominent Disclaimer:**
    *   **AI-generated output MUST always be accompanied by a clear and prominent disclaimer stating that the content is for informational purposes only, is not legal advice, and that a qualified attorney should be consulted.**

## 2. Key Stages & Processes Involved

1.  **Understand User's Need for a Clause:**
    *   What type of agreement is it for? (e.g., NDA, Service Agreement, Lease).
    *   What specific issue or provision does the user want the clause to address? (e.g., confidentiality, payment terms, termination, limitation of liability).
2.  **Identify Standard Components of Such a Clause:**
    *   Based on general knowledge of contract types, determine the typical elements and considerations for the requested clause.
3.  **Draft Sample Clause Language:**
    *   Generate text that incorporates these standard components.
    *   Use placeholders (e.g., `[Party A]`, `[Effective Date]`, `[Governing Law Jurisdiction]`) for specific details that would need to be filled in.
4.  **Include Optional/Alternative Phrasing (If appropriate):**
    *   May suggest common variations or points of negotiation for certain clauses.
5.  **Add Explanatory Notes (Optional but helpful):**
    *   Briefly explain the purpose or common implications of certain parts of the clause.
6.  **CRITICAL: Attach Disclaimer:**
    *   Ensure the output prominently features a disclaimer that it is not legal advice and professional legal counsel is required.

## 3. Inputs Required from User/System

*   **Type of Agreement:** (e.g., Non-Disclosure Agreement, Service Contract, Employment Agreement).
*   **Specific Purpose of the Clause:** (e.g., "a clause about intellectual property ownership," "a clause for late payment penalties").
*   **Key Terms or Conditions to be Included:** (e.g., "confidentiality period of 5 years," "interest rate of 1.5% per month on overdue invoices").
*   **Relationship Between Parties (Optional):** (e.g., buyer/seller, employer/employee, service provider/client).
*   **Jurisdictional Considerations (User should be aware AI cannot give jurisdiction-specific advice):** User might mention a jurisdiction, but AI response must still be general and disclaimed.

## 4. Potential Challenges & Considerations

*   **RISK OF BEING MISINTERPRETED AS LEGAL ADVICE (MITIGATED BY DISCLAIMER):** This is the primary challenge. AI cannot provide legal advice.
*   **Jurisdictional Differences:** Contract law varies significantly between jurisdictions. AI-generated clauses are general and not tailored to specific legal requirements of any location.
*   **Complexity of Legal Language:** Drafting truly effective and enforceable legal clauses requires deep legal expertise.
*   **Specificity of Situation:** Generic clauses may not adequately cover the unique aspects of a user's specific situation.
*   **Changing Laws:** Legal standards and interpretations evolve.

## 5. Metrics for Success (How to Evaluate Output)

*   **Presence & Prominence of Disclaimer:** Is the "not legal advice" disclaimer clear and unavoidable?
*   **Relevance to Request:** Does the sample clause address the user's stated need conceptually?
*   **Inclusion of Typical Elements:** Does it contain components commonly found in such a clause?
*   **Clarity of Sample Language:** Is the generated text understandable (as a sample)?
*   **Use of Placeholders:** Are specific, variable details appropriately indicated with placeholders?
*   **Educational Value (as an illustration):** Does it help the user understand what such a clause *might* look like or what points it *might* cover, before they consult a lawyer?
