*   **Consequences for Non-Compliance (for policies, if applicable):**

## 4. Potential Challenges & Considerations

*   **Legal & Regulatory Compliance:** Ensuring documents meet all applicable legal requirements (AI cannot guarantee this; user needs legal review).
*   **Clarity vs. Comprehensiveness:** Balancing the need for detail with ease of understanding.
*   **Enforceability:** Writing policies that can be practically enforced.
*   **Keeping Documents Up-to-Date:** Policies and procedures need regular review and revision.
*   **User Buy-in & Understanding:** Documents are only effective if understood and followed.
*   **Avoiding Overly Prescriptive Language:** Allowing for professional judgment where appropriate, while still providing clear guidance.

## 5. Metrics for Success (How to Evaluate Output)

*   **Clarity & Unambiguity:** Is the document easy to understand and interpret correctly?
*   **Completeness:** Does it cover all necessary aspects of the policy/procedure for its intended scope?
*   **Actionability (for procedures):** Can personnel follow the steps to achieve the desired outcome consistently?
*   **Consistency:** Does it align with organizational standards and other related documents?
*   **Perceived Authority & Professionalism:** Does it read like a formal organizational document?
*   **Usefulness as a Guide:** Does it effectively guide behavior or task execution?
*   **Inclusion of Disclaimer (if AI-generated for legal-like topics):** If touching on legal areas, does it include a disclaimer that it's not legal advice?
