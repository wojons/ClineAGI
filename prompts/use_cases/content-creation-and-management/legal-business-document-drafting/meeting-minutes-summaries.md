# Use Case Definition: Meeting Minutes & Summaries

**Objective:** To accurately record the key discussions, decisions, action items, and attendees of a meeting, or to create a concise summary of a longer meeting recording or transcript.

## 1. Core Requirements & Quality Indicators

*   **Accuracy:**
    *   Faithfully captures what was discussed and decided.
    *   Correctly attributes statements or action items to the right individuals.
*   **Completeness (for Minutes):**
    *   Includes all essential information: date, time, attendees, apologies for absence, topics discussed, key points made, decisions reached, action items (with assigned person and due date), and next meeting date (if set).
*   **Conciseness (for Summaries):**
    *   Distills the most important information from a longer meeting into a brief, digestible format.
*   **Clarity & Objectivity:**
    *   Written in clear, professional language.
    *   Maintains an objective tone, reporting facts rather than personal interpretations (unless a summary of opinions is requested).
*   **Action-Oriented (for Action Items):**
    *   Action items are clearly stated, assigned to a specific person/team, and have a due date.
*   **Timeliness:**
    *   Minutes/summaries are ideally produced and distributed shortly after the meeting.
*   **Standardized Format:**
    *   Often follows a consistent template for easy reading and archiving.

## 2. Key Stages & Processes Involved

1.  **Pre-Meeting Preparation (if taking live minutes):**
    *   Obtain meeting agenda.
    *   Prepare a template with fields for attendees, date, time, etc.
2.  **Information Gathering (During or After Meeting):**
    *   **Live Minutes:** Actively listen and take notes on key discussion points, decisions, and action items.
    *   **From Recording/Transcript:** Review the recording/transcript to extract essential information.
3.  **Identify Key Information:**
    *   **Attendees & Absentees:**
    *   **Main Topics Discussed (per agenda item):**
    *   **Key Arguments/Points Raised:**
    *   **Decisions Made:** Clearly state what was decided.
    *   **Action Items:** What needs to be done, who is responsible, and by when?
    *   **Voting Outcomes (if applicable):**
    *   **Next Steps/Future Agenda Items:**
4.  **Draft the Minutes/Summary:**
    *   Organize information logically, often following the agenda structure.
    *   Use clear and concise language.
    *   Maintain an objective tone.
    *   For summaries, focus on the most critical outcomes and action items.
5.  **Format the Document:**
    *   Use headings, bullet points, and tables (e.g., for action items) to improve readability.
    *   Include meeting details (date, time, location/platform, title).
6.  **Review & Verify:**
    *   Check for accuracy against notes or recording.
    *   Ensure all key decisions and action items are captured correctly.
    *   Proofread for grammar and spelling errors.
7.  **Distribute & Archive (Conceptual for AI):**
    *   In a real-world scenario, minutes are distributed to attendees for review/approval and then archived.

## 3. Inputs Required from User/System

*   **Meeting Agenda (Highly Recommended):**
*   **List of Attendees (and apologies for absence):**
*   **Date, Time, and Location/Platform of the Meeting:**
*   **Meeting Recording or Detailed Notes/Transcript (Essential if AI is generating after the fact):**
*   **Purpose/Title of the Meeting:**
*   **Any Specific Decisions or Action Items Known Beforehand:**
*   **Desired Format: Full Minutes or Concise Summary?**
*   **Template for Minutes (if company uses one):**

## 4. Potential Challenges & Considerations

*   **Capturing Nuance:** Minutes may not always capture the full nuance of a discussion.
*   **Attribution Accuracy:** Ensuring statements and action items are correctly assigned.
*   **Objectivity:** Avoiding personal bias in recording discussions.
*   **Information Overload:** Deciding what is important enough to include, especially in long or complex meetings.
*   **Deciphering Recordings:** Poor audio quality or unclear speakers can make transcription/summarization difficult.
*   **Timeliness of Distribution:** Delays can reduce the usefulness of minutes.

## 5. Metrics for Success (How to Evaluate Output)

*   **Accuracy:** Do the minutes/summary correctly reflect what happened in the meeting?
*   **Completeness:** Are all key decisions, discussions, and action items included?
*   **Clarity:** Is the document easy to understand?
*   **Conciseness (especially for summaries):** Is it to the point?
*   **Actionability:** Are action items clear, assigned, and dated?
*   **Objectivity:** Is the tone neutral and factual?
*   **Usefulness as a Record:** Does it serve as a reliable record of the meeting?
*   **Timeliness (if AI is assisting live or shortly after):**
