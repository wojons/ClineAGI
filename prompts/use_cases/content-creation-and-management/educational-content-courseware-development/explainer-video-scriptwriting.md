# Use Case Definition: Explainer Video Scriptwriting

**Objective:** To write a concise, engaging, and easy-to-understand script for a short explainer video (typically 1-3 minutes) that clearly communicates a concept, product, service, or process.

## 1. Core Requirements & Quality Indicators

*   **Clarity & Simplicity:**
    *   Explains complex topics in simple, accessible language.
    *   Avoids jargon or explains it clearly.
*   **Conciseness:**
    *   Delivers the core message efficiently within a short timeframe.
    *   Every word and scene contributes to the explanation.
*   **Engaging Narrative:**
    *   Grabs viewer attention quickly and maintains it throughout.
    *   May use storytelling, analogies, or relatable scenarios.
*   **Logical Flow:**
    *   Information is presented in a clear, logical sequence (e.g., Problem -> Solution -> Benefits -> Call to Action).
*   **Visual Storytelling Cues:**
    *   Script includes suggestions for visuals (animations, graphics, on-screen text, live-action scenes) that complement and enhance the narration.
*   **Clear Call to Action (if applicable):**
    *   If the video has a specific goal (e.g., visit website, sign up), it includes a clear CTA.
*   **Appropriate Tone & Pace:**
    *   Tone is suitable for the brand and target audience (e.g., friendly, professional, enthusiastic).
    *   Pacing of narration allows for visuals to sync and for viewers to absorb information.
*   **Memorability:**
    *   Key messages are easy to remember.

## 2. Key Stages & Processes Involved

1.  **Define Objective, Target Audience, and Key Message:**
    *   What is the primary goal of the video? (e.g., explain a product, simplify a concept).
    *   Who is the video for?
    *   What is the single most important takeaway for the viewer?
2.  **Determine Video Length & Style:**
    *   Estimate target duration (e.g., 60 seconds, 90 seconds, 2 minutes).
    *   Consider the visual style (e.g., animation, live-action, screen recording with voiceover).
3.  **Outline the Script (Storyboarding Conceptually):**
    *   **Hook (0-10 seconds):** Grab attention immediately, state the problem or core question.
    *   **Problem/Context (10-30 seconds):** Elaborate on the pain point or introduce the concept.
    *   **Solution/Explanation (30-70 seconds):** Introduce the product/service/concept as the solution or explain it clearly. Highlight key benefits/features.
    *   **Call to Action (Optional, 70-90 seconds):** Tell viewers what to do next.
    *   **Branding/Outro:** Reinforce brand, provide contact info.
4.  **Write the Narration Script:**
    *   Use conversational, clear, and concise language.
    *   Read aloud to check timing (approx. 150 words per minute for average narration pace).
    *   Break narration into short segments corresponding to potential scenes or visual changes.
5.  **Develop Visual Cues/Scene Descriptions:**
    *   For each segment of narration, describe the accompanying visuals.
    *   Think about how visuals can illustrate or reinforce the spoken words.
    *   (e.g., "Narrator: Our product simplifies X. Visual: Animation showing a complex process becoming simple").
6.  **Integrate On-Screen Text (if any):**
    *   Suggest key phrases or data points that could appear as text overlays.
7.  **Refine for Clarity, Engagement, and Timing:**
    *   Ensure the message is crystal clear.
    *   Cut any unnecessary words or complex sentences.
    *   Check that the script flows well and maintains interest.
    *   Adjust script length to fit the target duration.
8.  **Format as a Two-Column Script (Common):**
    *   Left column for Visuals/On-Screen Text.
    *   Right column for Audio/Narration/Sound Effects.

## 3. Inputs Required from User/System

*   **Topic/Product/Service/Concept to be Explained:**
*   **Primary Goal of the Video:**
*   **Target Audience:**
*   **Key Message(s) to Convey:**
*   **Desired Video Length (Approximate):**
*   **Brand Voice & Tone:**
*   **Call to Action (if any):**
*   **Any Specific Visual Ideas or Constraints (Optional):**
*   **Core Benefits/Features to Highlight:**
*   **Examples of Explainer Videos Liked by User (Optional):**

## 4. Potential Challenges & Considerations

*   **Brevity:** Condensing complex information into a very short script.
*   **Engagement:** Keeping viewers watching for the entire duration.
*   **Visual Thinking:** Scripting not just words but also guiding the visual narrative.
*   **Simplification without Oversimplification:** Explaining accurately but simply.
*   **Pacing:** Matching narration speed with visual complexity and viewer comprehension.
*   **Production (Beyond AI Scope):** AI writes the script; actual video production (animation, filming, editing, voiceover) is a separate, complex process.

## 5. Metrics for Success (How to Evaluate Output)

*   **Clarity of Explanation:** Does the script make the topic easy to understand?
*   **Engagement Factor:** Is the script interesting and likely to hold viewer attention?
*   **Conciseness:** Does it deliver the message effectively within the typical short timeframe of an explainer video?
*   **Actionability of Visual Cues:** Are the suggestions for visuals clear and helpful for a video producer/animator?
*   **Logical Flow:** Does the script progress in a clear and understandable manner?
*   **Effectiveness of CTA (if present):** Is the call to action clear and compelling?
*   **Tone Appropriateness:** Does the script's tone match the brand and target audience?
*   **Completeness (for the core message):** Does it cover the essential points needed to achieve the video's objective?
