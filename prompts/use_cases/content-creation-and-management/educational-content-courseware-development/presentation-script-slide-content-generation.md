# Use Case Definition: Presentation Script & Slide Content Generation

## 2. Key Stages & Processes Involved

1.  **Define Presentation Objective & Target Audience:**
    *   What is the main purpose of the presentation? (e.g., to inform, persuade, train, entertain).
    *   Who will be listening? What are their interests and prior knowledge?
2.  **Outline Presentation Structure:**
    *   Develop a high-level outline:
        *   **Opening/Hook:** Grab audience attention, state purpose.
        *   **Main Body:** 2-5 key sections or talking points.
        *   **Conclusion:** Summarize key messages, call to action (if any), Q&A.
3.  **Develop Content for Each Section:**
    *   Brainstorm key information, arguments, examples, and stories for each part of the outline.
4.  **Allocate Content to Slides:**
    *   Decide what information will go on each slide.
    *   Focus on one key idea or a few related points per slide.
5.  **Write Slide Content (Headlines & Key Bullet Points):**
    *   Craft clear, concise headlines for each slide.
    *   Write brief bullet points or short phrases summarizing key information.
6.  **Suggest Visuals for Slides:**
    *   For each slide, suggest appropriate visuals (e.g., "diagram illustrating X," "photo representing Y," "chart showing Z data," "relevant icon").
7.  **Write Speaker Notes (Script) for Each Slide:**
    *   Expand on the slide content with more detailed explanations, examples, anecdotes, and transitions.
    *   Write in a conversational style, as if speaking directly to the audience.
    *   Include cues for when to advance slides or refer to specific visuals.
8.  **Craft Introduction & Conclusion:**
    *   Develop a strong opening to engage the audience and set the stage.
    *   Create a memorable conclusion that reinforces key messages and provides a sense of closure.
9.  **Plan for Q&A (Optional):**
    *   Anticipate potential questions and briefly note key talking points for answers.
10. **Review & Refine:**
    *   Read through the entire presentation (script and slide content).
    *   Check for clarity, logical flow, engagement, and timing.
    *   Ensure consistency in tone and messaging.
    *   Proofread.

## 3. Inputs Required from User/System

*   **Topic of the Presentation:**
*   **Main Objective/Purpose:**
*   **Target Audience Profile:**
*   **Allocated Time for Presentation:**
*   **Key Messages or Information to Convey:**
*   **Desired Structure or Number of Main Points (Optional):**
*   **Any Specific Data, Examples, or Stories to Include:**
*   **Brand/Company Style Guidelines (if applicable):**
*   **Preferred Presentation Software (Optional, might influence visual suggestions):** (e.g., PowerPoint, Google Slides, Keynote, Slidev).

## 4. Potential Challenges & Considerations

*   **Information Overload:** Trying to cram too much information into the presentation or onto individual slides.
*   **"Death by PowerPoint":** Relying too heavily on text-dense slides rather than engaging visuals and spoken narrative.
*   **Pacing & Timing:** Accurately judging how long each section will take to present.
*   **Audience Engagement:** Keeping the audience interested and attentive.
*   **Visual Design (Beyond AI Scope):** AI suggests content for visuals, but actual graphic design is separate.
*   **Delivery Skills (Beyond AI Scope):** The effectiveness of the presentation also depends on the presenter's delivery.

## 5. Metrics for Success (How to Evaluate Output)

*   **Clarity of Message:** Is the core purpose and key takeaways of the presentation clear?
*   **Logical Structure:** Does the presentation flow well from one point to the next?
*   **Engagement Potential:** Is the script interesting and the slide content supportive rather than distracting?
*   **Audience Appropriateness:** Is the content and language suitable for the intended audience?
*   **Balance of Script & Slides:** Do the speaker notes effectively complement the concise slide content?
*   **Actionability (for presenter):** Can a presenter confidently deliver this presentation based on the script and slide content?
*   **Completeness:** Does it cover the topic adequately for the given objective and time?
*   **Visual Suggestions:** Are the ideas for visuals relevant and likely to enhance understanding?
