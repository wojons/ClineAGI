# Use Case Definition: Speech & Monologue Writing

**Objective:** To draft a compelling and well-structured speech or monologue for a specific occasion, audience, and purpose, conveying key messages effectively and engagingly.

## 1. Core Requirements & Quality Indicators

*   **Clear Purpose & Key Message(s):**
    *   The speech/monologue has a defined objective (e.g., to inform, persuade, inspire, entertain, commemorate).
    *   Core messages are clearly articulated.
*   **Audience Appropriateness:**
    *   Tone, language, style, and content are tailored to the intended audience.
*   **Logical Structure & Flow:**
    *   Organized with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion.
    *   Ideas progress logically, and transitions are smooth.
*   **Engaging Content:**
    *   Uses storytelling, anecdotes, rhetorical questions, humor (if appropriate), or other techniques to capture and maintain audience interest.
*   **Persuasiveness (if applicable):**
    *   If the goal is to persuade, arguments are well-supported and compelling.
*   **Emotional Connection (if applicable):**
    *   Evokes the desired emotional response from the audience.
*   **Clarity & Conciseness:**
    *   Language is clear, direct, and easy to follow when spoken.
    *   Avoids unnecessary jargon or overly complex sentences.
*   **Appropriate Length/Timing:**
    *   The length is suitable for the allocated speaking time (AI can be given a target duration, and word count can be estimated for speaking pace).
*   **Memorable Opening & Closing:**
    *   Starts strong to grab attention and ends with impact.
*   **Natural Speaking Rhythm:**
    *   Written in a way that sounds natural when spoken, not like a written essay.

## 2. Key Stages & Processes Involved

1.  **Define Purpose, Audience, Occasion, and Key Message(s):**
    *   Why is this speech/monologue being given? Who is listening? What is the context? What are the most important points to convey?
2.  **Brainstorm Core Ideas & Supporting Material:**
    *   Gather relevant information, stories, examples, data, or quotes.
3.  **Outline the Structure:**
    *   **Introduction:** Hook, introduce self/topic, state purpose/thesis.
    *   **Body:** Develop 2-5 main points, each supported by evidence, examples, or stories. Organize logically (e.g., chronologically, thematically, problem-solution).
    *   **Conclusion:** Summarize key messages, restate thesis in a new way, provide a call to action (if any), end with a memorable closing statement.
4.  **Draft the Content for Each Section:**
    *   Write in a conversational, spoken style.
    *   Use rhetorical devices effectively (e.g., repetition, parallelism, metaphor).
    *   Incorporate transitions between points.
5.  **Craft Engaging Opening & Memorable Closing:**
6.  **Consider Delivery Cues (Optional):**
    *   May suggest pauses, emphasis, or tone shifts for the speaker (though actual delivery is up to the speaker).
7.  **Refine for Clarity, Impact, and Flow:**
    *   Read the draft aloud to check for rhythm, pacing, and natural language.
    *   Ensure arguments are logical and messages are clear.
    *   Cut unnecessary words or sections to fit time constraints.
8.  **Time the Speech (Conceptual for AI):**
    *   Estimate speaking time based on word count (average speaking rate is ~120-150 words per minute).

## 3. Inputs Required from User/System

*   **Topic of the Speech/Monologue:**
*   **Purpose/Objective:** (e.g., wedding toast, keynote address, product launch, dramatic monologue for a character).
*   **Target Audience:** (Size, demographics, prior knowledge, relationship to speaker).
*   **Occasion/Context:**
*   **Key Messages or Points to Convey:**
*   **Desired Tone:** (e.g., humorous, serious, inspirational, formal, informal).
*   **Approximate Desired Length or Speaking Time:**
*   **Specific Anecdotes, Data, or Quotes to Include (Optional):**
*   **Information about the Speaker (if relevant, e.g., for a personal story):**
*   **Call to Action (if any):**

## 4. Potential Challenges & Considerations

*   **Audience Engagement:** Crafting content that truly resonates with and holds the attention of the specific audience.
*   **Authenticity of Voice:** Ensuring the speech sounds natural for the intended speaker.
*   **Balancing Information with Emotion/Entertainment:**
*   **Timing:** Accurately writing to a specific time limit.

*   **Impact of Opening & Closing:**
