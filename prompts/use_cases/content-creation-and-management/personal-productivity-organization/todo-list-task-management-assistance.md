# Use Case Definition: To-Do List & Task Management Assistance

**Objective:** To help users create, organize, prioritize, and manage their to-do lists and tasks, often by breaking down larger goals into actionable steps or suggesting prioritization strategies.

## 1. Core Requirements & Quality Indicators

*   **Clear Task Capture:**
    *   Accurately records tasks as described by the user.
*   **Task Decomposition:**
    *   Can break down larger, complex tasks or goals into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks.
*   **Prioritization Assistance (Conceptual):**
    *   Can suggest ways to prioritize tasks based on user-defined criteria (e.g., urgency, importance, effort, deadlines).
    *   May use common prioritization frameworks if prompted (e.g., Eisenhower Matrix - Urgent/Important).
*   **Organization & Categorization:**
    *   Can group tasks by project, context, due date, or other user-defined categories.
    *   Presents lists in a clear, organized format.
*   **Actionable Items:**
    *   Ensures tasks are phrased as clear, actionable items, typically starting with a verb.
*   **Reminder/Deadline Setting (Conceptual):**
    *   Can associate due dates or reminder times with tasks (actual reminder functionality depends on external tools).
*   **Status Tracking (Conceptual):**
    *   Can help user update task statuses (e.g., to-do, in-progress, completed), though AI itself doesn't maintain live state.

## 2. Key Stages & Processes Involved

1.  **Gather Tasks & Goals:**
    *   Collect all tasks, projects, or goals from the user. This could be a brain dump or a more structured list.
2.  **Clarify & Decompose Tasks:**
    *   For larger or vague tasks, ask clarifying questions or suggest breaking them into smaller, specific sub-tasks.
    *   Ensure each task is actionable.
3.  **Assign Attributes (Optional):**
    *   For each task, add relevant attributes if provided by user or inferred:
        *   Due Date
        *   Priority Level (e.g., High, Medium, Low)
        *   Project/Category
        *   Estimated Effort/Time
        *   Assigned to (if collaborative)
4.  **Suggest Prioritization (if requested):**
    *   Based on attributes like due date and priority, suggest an order for tackling tasks.
    *   May introduce simple prioritization techniques (e.g., "Eat the Frog," "MoSCoW").
5.  **Organize & Present List:**
    *   Format the to-do list clearly, perhaps grouped by priority, project, or due date.
    *   Use checkboxes (Markdown: `- [ ]` for incomplete, `- [x]` for complete) for easy tracking.
6.  **Facilitate Updates (User-Driven):**
    *   User informs AI of completed tasks or changes, and AI can regenerate the updated list.

## 3. Inputs Required from User/System

*   **List of Tasks, Goals, or Projects:**
*   **Deadlines or Timeframes (if any):**
*   **Priorities (if user has them, or criteria for prioritization):**
*   **Context for Tasks (Optional):** (e.g., "work tasks," "personal errands," "project X tasks").
*   **Preferred Organizational Structure (Optional):** (e.g., "group by project," "show most urgent first").

## 4. Potential Challenges & Considerations

*   **Overwhelm:** A very long, unprioritized list can be demotivating.
*   **Procrastination (Human Factor):** AI can help organize, but execution is up to the user.
*   **Changing Priorities:** Task lists are often dynamic; AI needs to be able to help re-prioritize.
*   **Estimation Difficulty:** Accurately estimating time/effort for tasks can be hard.
*   **Integration with Tools (Beyond AI Scope):** AI generates text-based lists; integration with dedicated to-do apps requires separate mechanisms.
*   **Maintaining Motivation (Human Factor):**

## 5. Metrics for Success (How to Evaluate Output)

*   **Clarity & Actionability of Tasks:** Are all items clear and phrased as actions?
*   **Completeness of Capture:** Have all user-mentioned tasks been included?
*   **Logical Organization:** Is the list structured in a helpful way?
*   **Effectiveness of Prioritization Suggestions (if applicable):**
*   **Usefulness for Planning:** Does the list help the user see what needs to be done and in what order?
*   **Ease of Updating (Conceptual):** Is the format such that a user could easily mark items complete or add new ones (even if just by re-prompting AI with updates)?
