# Use Case Definition: Note-Taking & Information Organization

**Objective:** To assist users in capturing, structuring, and organizing notes and information from various sources (e.g., meetings, lectures, readings, brainstorming sessions) into a coherent and easily retrievable format.

## 1. Core Requirements & Quality Indicators

*   **Accurate Capture of Information:**
    *   Key points, facts, decisions, and action items from the source are accurately recorded.
*   **Logical Structure & Organization:**
    *   Notes are organized logically (e.g., by topic, date, meeting agenda item, hierarchical outline).
    *   Uses headings, bullet points, and indentation effectively for clarity.
*   **Summarization & Condensation (if requested):**
    *   Can condense lengthy input into concise notes while retaining essential information.
*   **Identification of Key Themes/Topics:**
    *   Can identify and tag or categorize notes by main themes.
*   **Extraction of Action Items/Decisions:**
    *   Clearly highlights any action items, deadlines, or key decisions made.
*   **Format Flexibility:**
    *   Can produce notes in various text-based formats (e.g., plain text, Markdown).
    *   May follow specific note-taking methodologies if prompted (e.g., Cornell Notes outline).
*   **Clarity & Readability:**
    *   Notes are easy to read and understand.

## 2. Key Stages & Processes Involved

1.  **Understand Source Material & Note-Taking Goal:**
    *   What is the source of information (e.g., meeting transcript, article, user's verbal input)?
    *   What is the purpose of the notes (e.g., personal record, sharing with team, study aid)?
2.  **Identify & Extract Key Information:**
    *   Listen for/read for main ideas, supporting details, examples, questions, action items, decisions, important names/dates/figures.
3.  **Structure the Notes:**
    *   Choose an organizational structure (e.g., chronological, thematic, by speaker, Q&A).
    *   Use headings, subheadings, bullet points, and indentation.
4.  **Summarize & Paraphrase:**
    *   Rephrase information concisely in the note-taker's (or AI's) own words, while preserving accuracy.
    *   Avoid verbatim transcription unless specifically requested for quotes.
5.  **Highlight Action Items & Decisions:**
    *   Use a clear marker (e.g., "ACTION:", "DECISION:") or a separate section for these.
6.  **Add Metadata (Optional):**
    *   Include date, topic, attendees (for meetings), source, etc.
7.  **Review & Refine:**
    *   Check notes for accuracy, completeness (for the intended scope), clarity, and consistency.

## 3. Inputs Required from User/System

*   **Source Material:** (e.g., text to summarize, transcript of a meeting/lecture, user's spoken thoughts for dictation).
*   **Purpose of the Notes:**
*   **Desired Format or Structure (Optional):** (e.g., "meeting minutes format," "outline style," "Cornell notes").
*   **Key Topics or Information to Focus On (Optional):**
*   **Length or Level of Detail for Notes (Optional):**

## 4. Potential Challenges & Considerations

*   **Information Overload from Source:** Sifting through large amounts of information to find key points.
*   **Ambiguity or Unclear Source Material:**
*   **Speed of Input (for live note-taking):** Keeping up with a fast-paced meeting or lecture.
*   **Subjectivity in Determining "Key" Information:**
*   **Maintaining Context:** Ensuring notes make sense when reviewed later without the full original context.
*   **Distinguishing Fact from Opinion (if in source):**

## 5. Metrics for Success (How to Evaluate Output)

*   **Accuracy & Completeness:** Do the notes accurately reflect the key information from the source?
*   **Clarity & Conciseness:** Are the notes easy to understand and to the point?
*   **Organization:** Is the information structured logically and easy to navigate?
*   **Identification of Action Items/Decisions:** Are these clearly highlighted?
*   **Usefulness:** Do the notes serve their intended purpose (e.g., as a reliable record, study aid, basis for action)?
*   **Adherence to Requested Format:**
