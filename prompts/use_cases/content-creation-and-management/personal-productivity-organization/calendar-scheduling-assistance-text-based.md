# Use Case Definition: Calendar & Scheduling Assistance (Text-Based)

**Objective:** To help users organize their schedule by interpreting natural language requests to create, modify, or query calendar events, and presenting this information in a clear, text-based format (e.g., a list of events, a textual representation of a weekly schedule). AI does not directly interact with calendar applications.

## 1. Core Requirements & Quality Indicators

*   **Accurate Interpretation of Date/Time:**
    *   Correctly understands natural language references to dates, times, durations, and recurring patterns (e.g., "next Tuesday at 3 PM," "every Monday for 4 weeks," "a 1-hour meeting").
*   **Extraction of Event Details:**
    *   Identifies key event information: title/description, date, start time, end time/duration, location (if any), attendees (if any).
*   **Logical Scheduling:**
    *   Avoids obvious scheduling conflicts if existing schedule information is provided.
    *   Handles time zone conversions conceptually if different time zones are mentioned (AI itself doesn't perform live conversions but can note the need).
*   **Clear Textual Representation of Schedule:**
    *   Presents calendar information (e.g., a day's events, a week's overview) in an easy-to-read text format.
*   **Confirmation of Actions:**
    *   Clearly states what event has been (conceptually) created, modified, or deleted based on user request.
*   **Query Handling:**
    *   Can answer questions about the schedule based on provided information (e.g., "What do I have on Wednesday afternoon?", "Am I free next Monday morning?").

## 2. Key Stages & Processes Involved

1.  **Understand User Request:**
    *   Determine if the user wants to:
        *   Create a new event.
        *   Modify an existing event (e.g., reschedule, change duration, add attendees).
        *   Delete an event.
        *   Query their schedule.
2.  **Parse Event Details from Natural Language:**
    *   Extract event title, date(s), start/end times or duration, location, attendees.
    *   Resolve relative dates/times (e.g., "tomorrow," "next week").
3.  **Handle Event Creation/Modification/Deletion (Conceptual):**
    *   If creating: Formulate the event details.
    *   If modifying: Identify the target event (user needs to specify clearly) and the changes.
    *   If deleting: Identify the target event.
    *   (AI generates text describing these actions, not performing them in a real calendar).
4.  **Check for Conflicts (if existing schedule data is provided):**
    *   If the user provides their current schedule, check if a new or rescheduled event conflicts with existing ones. Notify user of conflicts.
5.  **Format Schedule Information for Output:**
    *   Present event details or a schedule overview in a clear text format (e.g., list, simple table).
    *   Example for a single event: "Meeting: Project Sync - Date: 2024-07-16 - Time: 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM - Location: Conference Room B."
    *   Example for daily schedule:
        ```
        Tuesday, July 16, 2024:
        - 09:00 AM - 09:30 AM: Team Standup
        - 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM: Client Call - Project Alpha
        - 02:00 PM - 03:30 PM: Design Review
        ```
6.  **Respond to Queries:**
    *   Based on the (provided) schedule data, answer user questions about availability or specific events.

## 3. Inputs Required from User/System

*   **User's Request in Natural Language:** (e.g., "Schedule a meeting with John for next Monday at 2 PM for 1 hour about the budget," "What's on my calendar for tomorrow?").
*   **Existing Schedule Information (if querying or checking conflicts):** User would need to provide this, perhaps as text or a list of current events. AI does not have access to live calendar data.
*   **Default Time Zone (Important for clarity):** User should specify or AI should assume a default and state it.
*   **Preferred Date/Time Format for Output (Optional):**

## 4. Potential Challenges & Considerations

*   **Ambiguity in Natural Language:** "Next Friday" can be ambiguous. AI may need to ask for clarification or state its assumption.
*   **Time Zone Complexity:** Handling events across different time zones accurately.
*   **Recurring Events:** Interpreting and representing complex recurrence patterns (e.g., "every third Thursday").
*   **Lack of Real Calendar Integration:** AI can only manage schedule information textually based on what the user provides. It cannot send invites, set actual reminders, or sync with calendar apps.
*   **Conflict Resolution:** AI can identify conflicts if given data, but resolving them requires user decisions.
*   **Privacy:** Users should be mindful of sharing detailed personal schedule information.

## 5. Metrics for Success (How to Evaluate Output)

*   **Accuracy of Date/Time Interpretation:** Are dates, times, and durations understood correctly?
*   **Correct Extraction of Event Details:**
*   **Clarity of Textual Schedule Representation:** Is the output easy to read and understand?
*   **Logical Conflict Detection (if schedule provided):**
*   **Helpfulness of Query Responses:** Are questions about the schedule answered accurately based on provided data?
*   **Effectiveness in Assisting Organization:** Does the AI's output help the user manage their schedule conceptually?
