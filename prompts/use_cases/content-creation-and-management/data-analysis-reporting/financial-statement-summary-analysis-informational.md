# Use Case Definition: Financial Statement Summary & Analysis (Informational)

**Objective:** To summarize key figures from financial statements (e.g., income statement, balance sheet, cash flow statement) and provide a basic, high-level analysis of trends or ratios. **This is for informational and illustrative purposes ONLY and does NOT constitute financial or investment advice. Users MUST consult with a qualified financial professional for advice.**

## 1. Core Requirements & Quality Indicators

*   **Accurate Data Extraction:**
    *   Correctly identifies and extracts key line items from provided financial statements (e.g., revenue, net income, total assets, total liabilities, operating cash flow).
*   **Correct Calculation of Basic Ratios (if requested):**
    *   If asked to calculate common ratios (e.g., current ratio, debt-to-equity, profit margin), the formulas are applied correctly to the extracted data.
*   **Clear Summary of Key Figures:**
    *   Presents the most important financial numbers in an easy-to-understand format.
*   **Identification of Basic Trends (if comparing periods):**
    *   Highlights significant changes or trends when comparing data from multiple periods (e.g., "Revenue increased by X% year-over-year").
*   **Understandable Language (for a non-expert, if specified):**
    *   Explains financial terms simply if the target audience is not financially savvy.
*   **Prominent Disclaimer:**
    *   **AI-generated output MUST always be accompanied by a clear and prominent disclaimer stating that the content is for informational purposes only, is not financial/investment advice, and that a qualified financial professional should be consulted.**

## 2. Key Stages & Processes Involved

1.  **Understand User Request & Identify Statements:**
    *   What financial statements are provided (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow)?
    *   What specific information, ratios, or trends does the user want to see?
2.  **Extract Key Data Points:**
    *   Identify and pull relevant line items from the provided statements. This might involve parsing text or structured data (e.g., from a CSV or table).
3.  **Perform Calculations (if requested):**
    *   Calculate requested financial ratios using standard formulas.
    *   Calculate percentage changes or differences between periods if comparative data is available.
4.  **Summarize Key Figures & Trends:**
    *   Present the extracted data and calculated metrics in a structured way (e.g., tables, bullet points).
    *   Write a brief narrative highlighting significant figures, trends, or ratio results.
5.  **Add Explanatory Notes (Optional):**
    *   Briefly explain what key terms or ratios mean, especially if for a general audience.
6.  **CRITICAL: Attach Disclaimer:**
    *   Ensure the output prominently features a disclaimer that it is not financial advice.

## 3. Inputs Required from User/System

*   **Financial Statement Data:** (e.g., text of income statement, balance sheet, cash flow statement; or structured data like CSV/Excel).
*   **Specific Line Items of Interest (Optional):**
*   **Financial Ratios to Calculate (Optional):** (e.g., "calculate current ratio," "show gross profit margin").
*   **Periods for Comparison (if applicable):** (e.g., "compare Q1 2023 to Q1 2024").
*   **Target Audience for the Summary/Analysis (Optional):** (e.g., "explain for someone new to finance").

## 4. Potential Challenges & Considerations

*   **RISK OF BEING MISINTERPRETED AS FINANCIAL ADVICE (MITIGATED BY DISCLAIMER):** AI cannot provide financial or investment advice.
*   **Accuracy of Input Data:** The quality of the summary/analysis depends heavily on the accuracy and completeness of the financial statements provided by the user.
*   **Complexity of Financial Analysis:** True financial analysis requires deep expertise, understanding of accounting standards, industry context, and forward-looking judgment, which AI cannot replicate.
*   **Interpretation vs. Calculation:** AI can calculate ratios but interpreting their significance in context is a human expert task.
*   **Varying Accounting Standards & Presentation:** Financial statements can differ in format.

## 5. Metrics for Success (How to Evaluate Output)

*   **Presence & Prominence of Disclaimer:** Is the "not financial advice" disclaimer clear and unavoidable?
*   **Accuracy of Data Extraction & Calculations:** Are numbers pulled correctly and ratios calculated accurately based on standard formulas?
*   **Clarity of Summary:** Is the presentation of key figures and trends easy to understand?
*   **Relevance to User Request:** Does it address the specific information or ratios the user asked for?
*   **Educational Value (as an illustration of data points):** Does it help the user see key numbers from the statements in a summarized way, before they consult a financial professional?
*   **Objectivity of Language:** Does the analysis stick to factual summarization rather than speculative interpretation or advice?
