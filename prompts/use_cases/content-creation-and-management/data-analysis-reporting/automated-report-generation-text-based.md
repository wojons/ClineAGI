# Use Case Definition: Automated Report Generation (Text-Based)

**Objective:** To generate structured, text-based reports summarizing data, analysis results, or system status, often based on templates and dynamic data inputs.

## 1. Core Requirements & Quality Indicators

*   **Data Integration:**
    *   Accurately incorporates data from specified sources (e.g., CSV files, database query results, API responses, log files).
*   **Template Adherence (if applicable):**
    *   Follows a predefined template or structure for the report.
*   **Clarity & Conciseness:**
    *   Presents information clearly and succinctly.
    *   Summarizes key findings effectively.
*   **Accuracy of Information:**
    *   All reported data, calculations, and summaries are correct.
*   **Customizable Sections:**
    *   Allows users to define which sections or data points to include.
*   **Logical Organization:**
    *   Report is structured logically with clear headings and sections.
*   **Professional Formatting (Text-Based):**
    *   Uses Markdown or plain text formatting effectively for readability (e.g., headings, lists, tables if text-based).
*   **Timeliness (if for scheduled reporting):**
    *   Can be (conceptually) triggered to run on a schedule.

## 2. Key Stages & Processes Involved

1.  **Define Report Purpose, Audience, and Key Metrics:**
    *   What is the goal of this report? Who is it for?
    *   What specific information or metrics need to be included?
2.  **Identify Data Sources:**
    *   Where will the data for the report come from? (e.g., file paths, database connection details, API endpoints).
3.  **Design Report Template/Structure:**
    *   Outline the sections of the report (e.g., Executive Summary, Key Performance Indicators, Detailed Findings, Trends, Conclusion/Recommendations).
    *   Define placeholders for dynamic data.
4.  **Develop Data Extraction & Processing Logic:**
    *   Write code/scripts to:
        *   Fetch data from sources.
        *   Clean and preprocess data (if necessary, can leverage "Data Cleaning" use case).
        *   Perform calculations or aggregations (e.g., sums, averages, counts, trends).
5.  **Generate Report Content:**
    *   Populate the report template with the processed data and calculated metrics.
    *   Write narrative summaries or interpretations of the data for different sections.
    *   (AI can help draft these narrative parts based on the data).
6.  **Format the Report:**
    *   Apply text-based formatting (Markdown is common) for headings, lists, tables.
7.  **Review & Validate:**
    *   Check the report for accuracy of data, calculations, and interpretations.
    *   Ensure it meets the initial requirements and is clear to the target audience.
8.  **Output/Save Report:**
    *   Save the generated report to a file (e.g., .txt, .md).

## 3. Inputs Required from User/System

*   **Data Source(s):** (e.g., path to CSV/Excel files, database query, API endpoint details).
*   **Report Template or Desired Structure/Sections:**
*   **Key Metrics & Data Points to Include:**
*   **Calculation/Aggregation Logic (if any):** (e.g., "calculate monthly average sales," "show top 5 performing products").
*   **Target Audience for the Report:**
*   **Desired Output Format (e.g., Markdown, plain text):**
*   **Frequency of Report (if recurring, for context):**

## 4. Potential Challenges & Considerations

*   **Data Source Reliability & Consistency:** Issues with input data can affect report accuracy.
*   **Complex Calculations & Logic:** Implementing sophisticated data analysis within the report generation script.
*   **Handling Large Volumes of Data:** Ensuring the generation process is efficient.
*   **Dynamic Content Generation:** Writing narrative that accurately and meaningfully reflects changing data.
*   **Maintaining Templates:** Keeping report templates up-to-date as requirements evolve.
*   **Error Handling:** Managing issues with data fetching or processing.

## 5. Metrics for Success (How to Evaluate Output)

*   **Accuracy of Reported Data & Calculations:**
*   **Clarity & Understandability of the Report:** Can the target audience easily grasp the information?
*   **Completeness:** Does the report include all requested information and metrics?
*   **Adherence to Template/Structure:**
*   **Usefulness for Decision-Making:** Does the report provide actionable insights or the necessary information for its intended purpose?
*   **Readability (Text-Based Formatting):** Is it well-formatted and easy to read?
*   **Correctness of Generated Script (if AI produces a script to generate reports):** Does the script run and produce the correct report?
