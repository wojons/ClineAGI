# Use Case Definition: API Documentation Generation

**Objective:** To generate clear, comprehensive, and accurate documentation for an Application Programming Interface (API), detailing its endpoints, request/response formats, authentication methods, parameters, error codes, and usage examples.

## 1. Core Requirements & Quality Indicators

*   **Accuracy & Completeness:**
    *   All public endpoints are documented.
    *   Information about request methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), parameters, headers, and authentication is correct and complete.
    *   Response formats (e.g., JSON, XML), status codes, and error messages are accurately described.
*   **Clarity & Understandability:**
    *   Documentation is easy for developers to understand, regardless of their familiarity with the API.
    *   Uses clear, concise language and avoids jargon where possible (or explains it).
*   **Actionable Examples:**
    *   Provides practical code examples for common use cases in one or more popular programming languages.
    *   Examples are correct and runnable.
*   **Standardized Format:**
    *   Often follows established API documentation standards or tools (e.g., OpenAPI Specification/Swagger, API Blueprint, Slate, ReadMe.com). AI can generate content suitable for these formats.
*   **Ease of Navigation:**
    *   Well-organized with a clear structure, making it easy for developers to find the information they need (e.g., by endpoint, by resource).
*   **Up-to-Date:**
    *   Documentation accurately reflects the current version and behavior of the API. (AI generates based on provided info; maintenance is key).
*   **Covers Key Aspects:**
    *   **Authentication:** How to authenticate requests.
    *   **Endpoints:** List of all available endpoints with their paths and HTTP methods.
    *   **Request Parameters:** Path parameters, query parameters, request body schema.
    *   **Response Schemas:** Structure of successful responses and error responses.
    *   **Status & Error Codes:** Meaning of different HTTP status codes returned by the API.
    *   **Rate Limiting (if applicable):** Information on usage limits.
    *   **Versioning (if applicable):** How API versions are handled.

## 2. Key Stages & Processes Involved

1.  **Gather API Specifications & Source Code (if available):**
    *   Collect all relevant information about the API: design documents, source code (especially controller/route definitions and data models), existing (even partial) documentation.
2.  **Identify All Endpoints & HTTP Methods:**
    *   List every accessible API endpoint and the HTTP methods it supports.
3.  **Document Each Endpoint:**
    *   For each endpoint:
        *   **Summary/Purpose:** Briefly explain what the endpoint does.
        *   **Path & Method:** (e.g., `GET /users/{id}`).
        *   **Authentication Requirements:**
        *   **Request Parameters:**
            *   Path parameters (e.g., `{id}`): Name, data type, description, required/optional.
            *   Query parameters: Name, data type, description, required/optional.
            *   Request Headers: Name, description, example values.
            *   Request Body: Schema (e.g., JSON object with fields, data types, descriptions), example.
        *   **Responses:**
            *   Success Responses: HTTP status code (e.g., 200 OK, 201 Created), description, response body schema, example.
            *   Error Responses: Possible HTTP status codes (e.g., 400, 401, 404, 500), description, error response body schema, example.
4.  **Document Global Information:**
    *   **Authentication:** Detailed explanation of how to authenticate with the API (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0).
    *   **Base URL:**
    *   **Rate Limiting:**
    *   **Versioning Strategy:**
    *   **General Error Handling Principles:**
5.  **Write Code Examples:**
    *   Provide clear, runnable code snippets demonstrating how to call key endpoints in popular languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java, cURL).
6.  **Structure & Organize Documentation:**
    *   Organize by resource, functionality, or endpoint.
    *   Create an overview/introduction.
    *   Ensure easy navigation (e.g., a table of contents, sidebar).
7.  **Review for Accuracy, Clarity, and Completeness:**
    *   Verify all information against the actual API behavior.
    *   Have another developer (or AI in a review role) check for clarity.

## 3. Inputs Required from User/System

*   **API Design Specifications or Source Code:** The most crucial input. This could be OpenAPI specs, controller/route definitions from code, database schemas, etc.
*   **Target Audience for Documentation:** (e.g., internal developers, external partners, public).
*   **List of Programming Languages for Code Examples:**
*   **Authentication Method(s) Used:**
*   **Information about Rate Limiting, Versioning (if applicable):**
*   **Desired Documentation Format/Tool (Optional):** (e.g., "generate Swagger UI compatible JSON," "Markdown for Slate").
*   **Examples of Existing API Documentation Liked by User (Optional):**

## 4. Potential Challenges & Considerations

*   **Keeping Documentation Synchronized with API Changes:** This is a major ongoing challenge. Automated generation from code/specs helps.
*   **Documenting Complex Workflows:** APIs involving multiple chained calls or asynchronous operations can be hard to document clearly.
*   **Technical Accuracy:** Ensuring all parameter names, data types, and response structures are perfectly correct.
*   **Balancing Detail with Simplicity:** Providing enough information without overwhelming the user.
*   **Maintaining Code Examples:** Ensuring examples remain correct as the API or client libraries evolve.

## 5. Metrics for Success (How to Evaluate Output)

*   **Accuracy:** Does the documentation correctly reflect the API's behavior?
*   **Completeness:** Are all necessary aspects (endpoints, params, auth, errors, examples) covered?
*   **Clarity:** Is the documentation easy for a developer to understand and use to integrate with the API?
*   **Actionability of Examples:** Can developers use the code examples to make successful API calls?
*   **Navigability & Organization:** Can information be found quickly?
*   **Adherence to Standards (if specified):** Does it meet OpenAPI or other formatting requirements?
*   **Reduction in Support Questions (Indirect):** Good documentation should reduce the need for developers to ask basic questions about API usage.
