# Use Case Definition: SMS/Push Notification Copywriting

**Objective:** To craft extremely concise, clear, and actionable copy for SMS messages and push notifications that effectively delivers information or prompts user engagement within very tight character limits.

## 1. Core Requirements & Quality Indicators

*   **Extreme Brevity:**
    *   Messages are very short, adhering to strict character limits (e.g., SMS ~160 characters, push notifications vary but are also brief).
    *   Every word counts.
*   **Clarity & Immediacy:**
    *   The core message must be instantly understandable.
    *   Users should grasp the purpose of the notification at a glance.
*   **Actionability (Often):**
    *   If the goal is to drive action, the desired action is clear and easy to perform (e.g., tap to view, reply with keyword).
    *   May include a short link (URL).
*   **Urgency/Timeliness (if applicable):**
    *   Effectively conveys time-sensitive information or offers.
*   **Personalization (where possible):**
    *   May include personalization tokens (e.g., user's name) to increase relevance.
*   **Brand Voice Consistency:**
    *   Maintains brand tone even in a very condensed format.
*   **Relevance & Context:**
    *   Notification is relevant to the user and their current context or recent interactions.
*   **Non-Intrusiveness (Consideration):**
    *   While aiming for attention, copy should not be overly aggressive or annoying, respecting the personal nature of these channels.

## 2. Key Stages & Processes Involved

1.  **Define Objective & Channel:**
    *   What is the specific goal of this SMS/push notification? (e.g., alert, reminder, promotion, update).
    *   Confirm if it's for SMS or a specific push notification platform (which might have slightly different constraints or capabilities).
2.  **Identify Target Audience & Context:**
    *   Who is receiving this message?
    *   What is the likely context in which they will receive it?
3.  **Determine the Single Most Important Piece of Information:**
    *   Given the brevity, focus on one core message.
4.  **Draft Multiple Copy Variations:**
    *   Write several versions, experimenting with different wording and calls to action.
    *   Focus on strong verbs and direct language.
5.  **Incorporate Emojis (Optional & Platform-Dependent):**
    *   Consider if a relevant emoji can enhance clarity or save space, but use sparingly and ensure it renders correctly.
6.  **Include a Clear Call to Action (if applicable):**
    *   Make it obvious what the user should do.
7.  **Add Shortened URLs (if linking):**
    *   Use URL shorteners if a link is necessary, to save characters.
8.  **Check Character Counts Rigorously:**
    *   Ensure all variations meet the specific character limits.
9.  **Review for Clarity, Impact, and Errors:**
    *   Read aloud to check for natural phrasing.
    *   Proofread carefully.

## 3. Inputs Required from User/System

*   **Core Message/Purpose of the Notification:**
*   **Target Channel:** SMS or specific Push Notification system.
*   **Specific Offer, Alert, or Information to Convey:**
*   **Call to Action (if any):**
*   **Link to Include (if any):**
*   **Target Audience Segment (Optional):**
*   **Brand Voice/Tone Preferences:**
*   **Any Mandatory Information (e.g., opt-out language for SMS marketing):**
*   **Character Limit (if known and specific):**

## 4. Potential Challenges & Considerations

*   **Severe Character Constraints:** The biggest challenge is conveying a meaningful message in so few characters.
*   **Lack of Formatting:** SMS, in particular, offers very limited formatting options.
*   **Risk of Being Perceived as Spam:** Users are sensitive to unsolicited or irrelevant messages on these channels.
*   **Timing of Delivery:** Crucial for relevance and engagement (though AI typically only drafts copy, not schedules).
*   **URL Shorteners:** Ensuring shortened links are trustworthy and work correctly.
*   **Emoji Compatibility:** Ensuring emojis render as intended across devices.

## 5. Metrics for Success (How to Evaluate Output)

*   **Clarity within Brevity:** Is the message instantly clear despite its shortness?
*   **Actionability:** If a CTA is present, is it clear and compelling?
*   **Adherence to Character Limits:** Does it fit the constraints?
*   **Impact Potential:** Is it likely to achieve its objective (e.g., get a tap, convey critical info)?
*   **Tone Appropriateness:** Is the tone suitable for the message and brand?
*   **Absence of Ambiguity:** Is there any room for misinterpretation?
