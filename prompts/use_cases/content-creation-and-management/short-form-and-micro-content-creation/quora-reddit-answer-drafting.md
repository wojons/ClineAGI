# Use Case Definition: Quora/Reddit Answer Drafting

**Objective:** To draft helpful, informative, and contextually appropriate answers to questions posted on platforms like Quora or Reddit, aiming to provide value to the asker and the wider community.

## 1. Core Requirements & Quality Indicators

*   **Directly Addresses the Question:**
    *   The answer clearly and directly responds to the specific question asked.
    *   Avoids going off-topic or providing irrelevant information.
*   **Accuracy & Informativeness:**
    *   Provides factually correct information.
    *   Offers genuine insights, explanations, or solutions.
*   **Platform-Appropriate Tone & Style:**
    *   Adopts a tone suitable for the specific platform and community (e.g., Quora tends to be more explanatory, Reddit can vary widely by subreddit).
    *   May be conversational, authoritative, empathetic, or humorous, as appropriate.
*   **Helpfulness & Value:**
    *   Aims to genuinely help the person who asked the question.
    *   Provides actionable advice, clear explanations, or useful resources.
*   **Clarity & Conciseness:**
    *   Well-structured and easy to understand.
    *   Gets to the point without unnecessary rambling, but provides sufficient detail.
*   **Evidence/Sources (if applicable):**
    *   If making factual claims or providing specific advice, citing sources or explaining the basis of the information can add credibility.
*   **Community Guidelines Awareness (Conceptual):**
    *   Answers should ideally align with the general etiquette and rules of the platform/subreddit (AI cannot know all specific rules, but can aim for generally good conduct).
*   **Non-Promotional (Usually):**
    *   Unless the context explicitly allows for it (e.g., a brand answering a product question), answers should be primarily helpful rather than overtly self-promotional.

## 2. Key Stages & Processes Involved

1.  **Understand the Question & Its Context:**
    *   Carefully read the original question to fully grasp what is being asked.
    *   Note any nuances, underlying assumptions, or specific constraints mentioned by the asker.
    *   Consider the platform and specific community (e.g., subreddit) where the question is posted.
2.  **Research/Recall Relevant Information:**
    *   Access knowledge relevant to answering the question. This might involve internal knowledge or synthesizing information from provided sources.
3.  **Formulate a Core Answer:**
    *   Develop the main points or a direct response to the question.
4.  **Structure the Answer:**
    *   Organize the information logically.
    *   Consider an introduction (acknowledging the question), the main body (providing the answer/explanation), and a brief conclusion or summary.
    *   Use bullet points, numbered lists, or formatting (like bolding) for readability if appropriate.
5.  **Elaborate with Details & Examples:**
    *   Provide supporting details, examples, or explanations to make the answer more comprehensive and understandable.
6.  **Cite Sources (if necessary/appropriate):**
    *   If the answer relies on specific data or external information, mention the source.
7.  **Adopt an Appropriate Tone:**
    *   Tailor the language and tone to the question and platform.
8.  **Review & Refine:**
    *   Check for accuracy, clarity, completeness, and helpfulness.
    *   Proofread for any errors.
    *   Ensure the answer directly addresses the original question.

## 3. Inputs Required from User/System

*   **The Question Posted on Quora/Reddit:** The full text of the question.
*   **Platform/Community Context:** (e.g., "This is for the r/explainlikeimfive subreddit," or "Answering a Quora question about X").
*   **Desired Persona/Stance (Optional):** (e.g., "Answer as an expert in Y," "Provide a neutral overview").
*   **Key Information/Sources to Use (Optional):** If the user wants specific information included or referenced.
*   **Any Points to Emphasize or Avoid:**
*   **Link to the Original Post (Optional but helpful for full context):**

## 4. Potential Challenges & Considerations

*   **Understanding Nuance and Intent:** Questions on these platforms can sometimes be poorly phrased, sarcastic, or have hidden assumptions.
*   **Varying Community Norms:** Different subreddits or Quora topics have distinct cultures and expectations.
*   **Avoiding "Well, Actually" Syndrome:** Providing helpful information without being condescending.
*   **Handling Opinion-Based Questions:** Clearly distinguishing between factual answers and opinions.
*   **Dealing with Misinformation in the Question:** Deciding whether to correct a premise or simply answer the question as asked.
*   **Brevity vs. Thoroughness:** Finding the right balance for the platform.

## 5. Metrics for Success (How to Evaluate Output)

*   **Directness of Answer:** Does it clearly and directly address the question asked?
*   **Helpfulness & Value:** Is the answer likely to be useful to the asker and other readers?
*   **Accuracy:** Is the information provided correct?
*   **Clarity:** Is the answer easy to understand?
*   **Appropriateness of Tone:** Does the tone fit the question and platform?
*   **Completeness (within reason):** Does it provide a reasonably thorough answer without being overly verbose?
*   **Engagement (Indirect):** Would this type of answer likely receive upvotes or positive comments in the given community?
