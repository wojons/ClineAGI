# Use Case Definition: Generating Image Captions & Alt Text

**Objective:** To generate concise, descriptive, and contextually relevant captions and alternative text (alt text) for images, enhancing accessibility and user engagement.

## 1. Core Requirements & Quality Indicators

*   **For Captions:**
    *   **Contextual Relevance:** Caption relates directly to the image and the surrounding content or platform.
    *   **Engagement:** May be witty, informative, or evocative to engage the viewer.
    *   **Brevity:** Typically short and to the point.
    *   **Brand Voice Consistency:** Aligns with the established brand tone.
    *   **Call to Action (Optional):** May encourage interaction or direct users.
*   **For Alt Text:**
    *   **Descriptive Accuracy:** Accurately describes the image content and function for users who cannot see it (e.g., using screen readers).
    *   **Conciseness:** Provides essential information without being overly verbose.
    *   **Contextual Purpose:** Explains *why* the image is there, if it's functional (e.g., "Submit button") or conveys important information.
    *   **Accessibility Compliance:** Helps meet web accessibility standards (WCAG).
    *   **SEO Benefit (Secondary):** Keywords can be included if natural and relevant, but primary purpose is accessibility.
    *   **Avoid Redundancy:** Does not repeat information already present in nearby text if the image is purely decorative or fully described by context. State if decorative (e.g., `alt="Decorative line separator"`).

## 2. Key Stages & Processes Involved

1.  **Image Analysis (Conceptual for AI - based on user description or image understanding capabilities):**
    *   Understand the key elements, subject, action, and mood of the image.
    *   If AI has vision capabilities, analyze the image directly. Otherwise, rely on user's description of the image.
2.  **Understand Context:**
    *   Where will this image be used? (e.g., blog post, social media, product page).
    *   What is the surrounding text or topic?
    *   What is the purpose of the image in this context?
3.  **Draft Caption(s):**
    *   Generate one or more caption options.
    *   Tailor the tone and style to the platform and audience.
    *   Consider adding relevant hashtags or mentions if for social media.
4.  **Draft Alt Text:**
    *   Describe the image's visual content accurately and concisely.
    *   Focus on what's important for understanding the image's purpose.
    *   If the image is a link, describe the destination or action.
    *   If the image contains text, include that text in the alt attribute (unless it's very long, then summarize).
    *   Indicate if an image is purely decorative if no other descriptive text is needed.
5.  **Review & Refine:**
    *   Check captions for engagement and relevance.
    *   Check alt text for accuracy, conciseness, and helpfulness for accessibility.
    *   Ensure consistency with brand voice.
    *   Proofread.

## 3. Inputs Required from User/System

*   **The Image Itself (or a detailed description of it if AI lacks vision):**
*   **Context of Use:** Where will the image and its caption/alt text appear? (e.g., specific webpage, social media platform).
*   **Purpose of the Image:** (e.g., illustrative, decorative, functional, informative).
*   **Surrounding Text/Topic (Highly Recommended):**
*   **Desired Tone/Style for Caption:**
*   **Key Message to Convey (for caption, if any):**
*   **Target Audience (Optional):**
*   **Keywords (Optional, mainly for SEO aspect of alt text if desired):**
*   **Call to Action for Caption (Optional):**

## 4. Potential Challenges & Considerations

*   **Subjectivity of Captions:** What one person finds engaging, another might not.
*   **Describing Complex Images Concisely (for Alt Text):** Balancing detail with brevity.
*   **Understanding Image Nuance without Vision (if AI relies on description):** The quality of user-provided image descriptions is key.
*   **Decorative vs. Informative Images:** Correctly identifying when alt text should be minimal or descriptive.
*   **Dynamic Content:** Ensuring captions and alt text remain relevant if images change.

## 5. Metrics for Success (How to Evaluate Output)

*   **Caption - Engagement & Relevance:** Is the caption interesting and related to the image and context?
*   **Caption - Tone:** Does it match the desired style?
*   **Alt Text - Accuracy:** Does it accurately describe the image content?
*   **Alt Text - Helpfulness:** Would it be useful to someone using a screen reader?
*   **Alt Text - Conciseness:** Is it to the point?
*   **Accessibility:** Does the alt text contribute to a more accessible experience?
*   **Adherence to Instructions:** Are all user requirements met?
