# Use Case Definition: Database Schema Generation (SQL DDL)

**Objective:** To generate SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) statements for creating or modifying database schemas (tables, columns, relationships, indexes) based on a conceptual data model or user requirements.

## 1. Core Requirements & Quality Indicators

*   **Correct SQL Syntax:**
    *   Generated DDL statements are syntactically correct for the specified SQL dialect (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, SQLite).
*   **Accurate Representation of Data Model:**
    *   The schema correctly implements the entities, attributes, data types, and relationships described by the user.
*   **Appropriate Data Type Selection:**
    *   Uses suitable SQL data types for each column based on the nature of the data (e.g., VARCHAR, INT, BOOLEAN, TIMESTAMP, TEXT).
*   **Primary & Foreign Key Definitions:**
    *   Correctly defines primary keys for tables.
    *   Accurately establishes foreign key relationships between tables to enforce referential integrity.
*   **Constraints:**
    *   Includes common constraints like NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK constraints where appropriate or specified.
*   **Index Suggestions/Creation (Optional):**
    *   May suggest or include DDL for creating indexes on frequently queried columns or foreign keys to improve performance.
*   **Readability & Formatting of SQL:**
    *   Generated SQL is well-formatted and easy to read.
*   **Normalization (Conceptual):**
    *   Aims for a reasonably normalized schema design to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity, based on the provided entities and relationships.

## 2. Key Stages & Processes Involved

1.  **Understand Data Requirements & Entities:**
    *   Identify the main entities (e.g., Users, Products, Orders).
    *   For each entity, list its attributes (fields/columns) and their characteristics (data type, optionality, uniqueness).
    *   Understand the relationships between entities (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many).
2.  **Map Entities to Tables:**
    *   Each primary entity typically becomes a table.
    *   Many-to-many relationships often require a separate join/link table.
3.  **Define Columns for Each Table:**
    *   For each attribute, define a column with an appropriate SQL data type.
    *   Specify constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, DEFAULT values).
4.  **Define Primary Keys:**
    *   Choose or create a primary key for each table (e.g., an auto-incrementing ID, a natural key).
5.  **Define Foreign Keys & Relationships:**
    *   Implement relationships between tables using foreign key constraints.
    *   Specify `ON DELETE` and `ON UPDATE` cascade actions if appropriate.
6.  **Consider Indexes:**
    *   Identify columns that will be frequently used in `WHERE` clauses, `JOIN` conditions, or `ORDER BY` clauses, and consider creating indexes on them. Foreign keys are often good candidates for indexes.
7.  **Generate SQL DDL Statements:**
    *   Write `CREATE TABLE` statements for each table.
    *   Write `ALTER TABLE` statements if modifying existing tables (less common for initial generation, more for migrations).
    *   Write `CREATE INDEX` statements.
8.  **Add Comments (Optional):**
    *   May include SQL comments to explain table or column purposes.
9.  **Order Statements Logically:**
    *   Ensure tables are created in an order that respects foreign key dependencies (i.e., create a referenced table before the table that references it).

## 3. Inputs Required from User/System

*   **Conceptual Data Model or List of Entities & Attributes:**
    *   Description of each entity (e.g., "Customer," "Order").
    *   For each entity, a list of attributes/fields with their intended data types (e.g., "Customer Name: string", "Order Date: date", "Quantity: integer").
*   **Relationships Between Entities:** (e.g., "A Customer can have many Orders," "A Product can be in many Orders, and an Order can have many Products").
*   **Specific SQL Dialect (Highly Recommended):** (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite). If not specified, might generate generic SQL or default to a common one like PostgreSQL.
*   **Primary Key Preferences (Optional):** (e.g., "use auto-incrementing integer IDs for all primary keys").
*   **Specific Constraints or Indexes Required (Optional):**

## 4. Potential Challenges & Considerations

*   **Normalization Levels:** Deciding on the appropriate level of database normalization (e.g., 3NF, BCNF) can be complex and depends on trade-offs. AI will likely aim for a reasonable default.
*   **Handling Many-to-Many Relationships:** Requires creating join tables.
*   **Data Type Nuances:** Choosing the most optimal data type (e.g., `VARCHAR(255)` vs. `TEXT`, `INT` vs. `BIGINT`) can depend on specific database and data characteristics.
*   **Performance Implications of Schema Design:** Indexing strategy, normalization choices, and data types all affect query performance.
*   **Evolution/Migration:** This use case focuses on initial schema generation. Modifying existing schemas (migrations) is a more complex task.
*   **SQL Dialect Differences:** SQL syntax can vary significantly between database systems.

## 5. Metrics for Success (How to Evaluate Output)

*   **Syntactic Correctness:** Is the generated SQL valid for the specified dialect?
*   **Logical Correctness:** Does the schema accurately represent the user's data model and relationships?
*   **Data Integrity:** Does the schema include appropriate primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints to help maintain data integrity?
*   **Readability:** Is the SQL code well-formatted and easy to understand?
*   **Completeness:** Are all specified entities, attributes, and relationships accounted for?
*   **Efficiency (Conceptual):** Does the schema seem reasonably designed for typical query patterns (e.g., basic indexing on foreign keys)?
*   **Adherence to Best Practices:** Does it follow common database design principles (e.g., reasonable normalization)?
