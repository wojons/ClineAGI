# Use Case Definition: Boilerplate Code Generation

**Objective:** To generate initial boilerplate code for a new project, module, component, or file based on a specified programming language, framework, and common structural patterns.

## 1. Core Requirements & Quality Indicators

*   **Correct Project/Module Structure:**
    *   Generates a standard directory structure and essential files for the specified project type or framework (e.g., `src`, `tests`, `public` directories; `package.json`, `main.py`, `index.html`).
*   **Basic Configuration Files:**
    *   Includes minimal, functional configuration files (e.g., `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript, `requirements.txt` or `Pipfile` for Python, basic `webpack.config.js`).
*   **Entry Point File(s):**
    *   Creates main application entry point(s) (e.g., `app.js`, `main.py`, `index.html` with a script tag).
*   **"Hello World" or Basic Example:**
    *   Often includes a simple, runnable example to demonstrate the basic setup is working.
*   **Adherence to Framework Conventions:**
    *   Follows the typical project layout and file naming conventions of the specified framework (e.g., Next.js, Django, Spring Boot, React).
*   **Essential Dependencies (Conceptual):**
    *   Lists or includes common starter dependencies in package manager files (e.g., `express` for a Node.js web server, `react` and `react-dom` for a React app).
*   **Readability & Cleanliness:**
    *   Boilerplate is clean, well-formatted, and free of unnecessary clutter.
*   **Comments for Key Sections (Optional):**
    *   May include comments indicating where to add specific logic or further configuration.

## 2. Key Stages & Processes Involved

1.  **Identify Project/Module Type & Technology Stack:**
    *   What kind of project is it (e.g., web application, CLI tool, library, mobile app component)?
    *   What programming language, framework, and key libraries will be used?
2.  **Determine Standard Directory Structure:**
    *   Based on the project type and framework, define the common directory layout.
3.  **Identify Essential Configuration Files:**
    *   List necessary config files and their basic content (e.g., package manager file, linter config, compiler config).
4.  **Create Main Entry Point(s):**
    *   Generate the initial code for the main file(s) that start the application or module.
5.  **Add Basic "Hello World" or Example Functionality:**
    *   Include a simple piece of code that can be run to verify the setup.
6.  **Generate Folder Structure & Files:**
    *   (Conceptually for AI) Describe the commands or actions to create directories and write the content for each boilerplate file.
7.  **Include README (Optional but good):**
    *   Generate a basic README.md with project title, brief description, and instructions on how to build/run.

## 3. Inputs Required from User/System

*   **Project Type:** (e.g., "React web app," "Python Flask API," "Node.js CLI tool," "Go library").
*   **Programming Language:**
*   **Framework (if any):** (e.g., Next.js, Django, Spring Boot, Express).
*   **Project Name (for naming root folder, package names, etc.):**
*   **Key Features or Modules to Include Stubs For (Optional):** (e.g., "include a basic auth module stub").
*   **Preferred Package Manager (if applicable, e.g., npm, yarn, pip, poetry):**
*   **Version Control Initialization Preference (Optional):** (e.g., "initialize a Git repository").

## 4. Potential Challenges & Considerations

*   **Keeping Up with Framework Changes:** Frameworks evolve, and boilerplate conventions can change.
*   **Opinionated vs. Minimal Boilerplate:** Deciding how much to include by default. Some users prefer minimal setups, others more feature-rich starters.
*   **Configuration Complexity:** Some frameworks require extensive initial configuration.
*   **Dependency Management:** Ensuring correct versions of starter dependencies.
*   **Build Tool Integration:** Setting up basic build tool configurations (e.g., Webpack, Parcel, Maven, Gradle).

## 5. Metrics for Success (How to Evaluate Output)

*   **Correctness of Structure:** Is the generated directory and file structure conventional for the specified project type/framework?
*   **Functionality of Basic Example:** Can the "Hello World" or initial example be run successfully (assuming dependencies are installed)?
*   **Completeness of Boilerplate:** Does it include the essential files and configurations to get started?
*   **Adherence to Conventions:** Does it follow common practices for the language/framework?
*   **Ease of Getting Started:** Does the boilerplate significantly reduce the initial setup effort for a developer?
*   **Readability & Cleanliness:** Is the generated code and structure easy to understand?
