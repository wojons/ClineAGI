# Use Case Definition: Code Snippet Generation

**Objective:** To generate a functional and well-written code snippet in a specified programming language to perform a specific task, implement an algorithm, or demonstrate the use of a particular function or library feature.

## 1. Core Requirements & Quality Indicators

*   **Functionality & Correctness:**
    *   The generated code snippet correctly implements the requested logic or algorithm.
    *   It is syntactically correct and should run without errors (given the appropriate environment and inputs).
*   **Clarity & Readability:**
    *   Code is well-formatted, easy to understand, and follows common style conventions for the language.
    *   Uses meaningful variable and function names.
*   **Efficiency (Context-Dependent):**
    *   Uses reasonably efficient algorithms and data structures for the task, without premature optimization for very small snippets.
*   **Conciseness:**
    *   Provides the necessary code to achieve the task without unnecessary boilerplate or unrelated logic.
*   **Completeness (for the snippet's scope):**
    *   Includes necessary imports or dependencies if they are standard and essential for the snippet to function (or notes them if they are project-specific).
    *   May include a brief example of how to call or use the generated function/snippet.
*   **Adherence to Language & Library Best Practices:**
    *   Uses idiomatic expressions and standard library features where appropriate.
*   **Comments (Optional but helpful for complex snippets):**
    *   May include brief comments to explain non-obvious parts of the logic.

## 2. Key Stages & Processes Involved

1.  **Understand Task & Requirements:**
    *   What specific function, algorithm, or task should the code snippet perform?
    *   What are the expected inputs and outputs?
    *   Are there any specific constraints or performance considerations?
2.  **Select Programming Language & Libraries:**
    *   Confirm the target language (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java, C++).
    *   Identify any standard libraries or frameworks that should be used.
3.  **Design Algorithm/Logic:**
    *   Outline the steps required to achieve the desired functionality.
    *   Choose appropriate data structures and control flow.
4.  **Write the Code:**
    *   Implement the logic in the specified language.
    *   Focus on clarity, correctness, and adherence to best practices.
5.  **Add Necessary Imports/Setup (Conceptual):**
    *   Include or note any required import statements or minimal setup for the snippet to be testable.
6.  **Include Usage Example (Optional):**
    *   Provide a short example demonstrating how to call the function or use the snippet.
7.  **Add Comments (If needed):**
    *   Explain complex or non-obvious parts of the code.
8.  **Review & Test (Conceptual for AI):**
    *   Mentally "run" the code with sample inputs to check for logical errors.
    *   Verify syntax and adherence to requirements.

## 3. Inputs Required from User/System

*   **Specific Task or Algorithm to Implement:** (e.g., "generate a Python function to sort a list using quicksort," "a JavaScript snippet to make an API call with fetch").
*   **Programming Language:**
*   **Expected Inputs & Their Types:**
*   **Expected Output & Its Type:**
*   **Any Specific Libraries or Frameworks to Use/Avoid (Optional):**
*   **Constraints or Edge Cases to Consider (Optional):**
*   **Desired Level of Efficiency or Complexity (Optional):**

## 4. Potential Challenges & Considerations

*   **Ambiguity in Requirements:** User requests can sometimes be unclear or incomplete.
*   **Handling Edge Cases:** Ensuring the snippet is robust and handles potential edge cases correctly.
*   **Dependencies:** Managing external library dependencies if the snippet relies on them.
*   **Context:** A snippet generated in isolation might need adjustments to fit into a larger codebase.
*   **Security (if applicable):** Ensuring snippets don't introduce vulnerabilities (e.g., if handling user input or making external calls).
*   **Over-Optimization:** Writing overly complex code for a simple task.

## 5. Metrics for Success (How to Evaluate Output)

*   **Correctness:** Does the snippet produce the correct output for given inputs? Does it correctly implement the requested algorithm/logic?
*   **Functionality:** Does the code run without errors (assuming correct environment)?
*   **Readability:** Is the code easy to understand and follow?
*   **Efficiency:** Is the approach reasonably efficient for the problem?
*   **Conciseness:** Is it free of unnecessary code?
*   **Adherence to Language Conventions:** Does it follow idiomatic practices for the specified language?
*   **Helpfulness of Examples/Comments (if included):**
*   **Completeness (for its scope):** Does it include necessary setup like imports to be runnable or easily integrated?
